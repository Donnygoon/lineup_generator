First, it's hard to tell whether Johnson will continue to play a leading role or fall into a time-share with Myles Gaskin, who had been the starter until last week. Gaskin had just come off the COVID-19 list two days before Johnson's big day, and maybe that had something to do with Gaskin's lesser role. Second, Johnson shredded a bad Jets defense.
