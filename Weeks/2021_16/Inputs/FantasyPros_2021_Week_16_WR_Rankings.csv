Perriman figures to play an enhanced role with WRs Chris Godwin and Mike Evans both out. Perriman isn't likely to see the sort of target volume that WR Antonio Brown and TE Rob Gronkowski will likely have, but Perriman is also the sort of deep-ball artist who can make his weekly fantasy quota with just one or two catches. In late 2019, with Godwin and Evans battling injuries, Perriman had 20-419-5 over the Bucs' final four regular-season games - and that was with Jameis Winston at quarterback rather than Tom Brady. Perriman lands at WR62 in this week's rankings, but he's an intriguing option if you're a heavy underdog and don't mind taking a risk on a receiver with a shaky floor but a lofty ceiling.",,,WR87,F,6.0,2.228089090909091

Unfortunately, out of their bye week, MVS only put up 20 receiving yards on three receptions and fantasy managers had to watch Allen Lazard steal all of that production. With that being said, MVS rebounded again in a big way in Week 15 and he was able to finish with a 5-98-1 stat line. Rodgers is looking to get him involved in the offense and he comes with incredible upside each and every week. There's still no predicting if it's going to be MVS' week to shine or if Lazard is going to receive an increased workload. We can't lock MVS into our starting lineups due to his volatility, but he's certainly worth considering as a low-end WR3/high-end FLEX play this week due to the upside he provides.",,,WR101,F,5.1,9.744672093023254
