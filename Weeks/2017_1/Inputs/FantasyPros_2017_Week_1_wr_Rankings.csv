Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,CLE,1,3,1.2,0.4,"The undisputed No. 1 wide receiver of Week 1, Brown will see a mixture of Joe Haden and Devin McCourty, who struggle to contain many wide receivers, let alone one of the best of the last 10 years. The only question here is whether or not ""Road Roethlisberger"" shows up. Brown has overcome his road struggles before, so there's no reason to doubt him now. "
2,Julio Jones,ATL,CHI,1,5,2.3,0.8,"Let the fireworks begin, as Jones will play one of the NFL's weaker secondaries. The Bears did sign multiple free agents, but no one that could hang with Jones. Expect him to see a lot of Prince Amukamara, who allowed five touchdowns on just 78 targets in coverage last year, including three over the final two weeks. He'll get help over the top, but Jones is a machine that can essentially counter anything the defense throws at him. "
3,A.J. Green,CIN,BAL,1,6,3.3,0.9,"Green missed both games against the Ravens last year due to injury, but if we go back to 2015 when he played them twice, Green destroyed them for 10 catches, 227 yards, and two touchdowns in the first meeting, and then posted four catches for 34 yards and a touchdown in their second meeting. When healthy, Green should always be in your lineup, and especially against the Ravens. "
4,Doug Baldwin,SEA,GB,2,21,5.9,3.2,"You saw what the Packers secondary allowed last year, right? If you somehow missed it, they allowed 31 passing touchdowns, with a majority of them going to wide receivers. The only concern is that Russell Wilson has often struggled in season openers, which lowers my expectations for Baldwin this week. But still, you're plugging him into your lineups.  "
5,Amari Cooper,OAK,TEN,2,17,6.6,2.8,"If you haven't sat down to watch some of Cooper's routes, do yourself a favor and do that. He's a technician in and out of his routes, which makes him a threat on the underneath stuff, as well as the deep routes. The Titans secondary has always been the weak point of their team and that addition of Adoree Jackson won't automatically fix that. If they stick the rookie on Cooper, he's going to learn some lessons. "
6,Jordy Nelson,GB,SEA,4,20,7.5,2.9,"If you've seen what the Packers do when they play a team like the Seahawks, you aren't very worried about Nelson. The Packers often stick their No. 3 wide receiver on Richard Sherman's side of the field and simply don't target him. That's not going to be Nelson, so don't worry about him. "
7,Michael Thomas,NO,MIN,3,20,7.9,3.0,"It'll be a tough test right out of the gate for Thomas in his sophomore season, lining up across from Xavier Rhodes, who is one of the better cover corners in the game. You have to have faith in Sean Payton to get creative and move him around the formation, which I do. Still, it's not the week to get too excited about Thomas. Don't worry, those weeks will come soon. "
8,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,DET,1,24,9.4,4.1,"Fitzgerald typically thrives in the early part of the season, and Week 1 this year should be no exception. The Lions allowed 20 touchdowns and the fifth-most fantasy points to wide receivers last season, making this a solid matchup for any receivers. That's especially true for Fitzgerald, considering his history of excelling in the early part of the season (averaging more than 85 yards receiving and a touchdown through the first five games of each of the last two seasons). Fitzgerald is a must-play option in all leagues."
9,Michael Crabtree,OAK,TEN,8,26,12.6,3.9,"In each of the past two seasons, Crabtree outperformed the hyped Amari Cooper in fantasy football. This week should be huge for the Raiders passing attack so you can bet Crabtree will be in the middle of it all."
10,Odell Beckham Jr.,NYG,DAL,2,47,11.5,11.2,"Beckham's status for Week 1 is in question, so pay attention to injury updates. Should he play, you have to put him in your lineup. The two starting cornerbacks and one of the starting safeties from 2016 for the Cowboys are both gone, which means Beckham will see oft-injured Orlando Scandrick and Nolan Carroll. He'll feast on this secondary if he's healthy. "
11,Dez Bryant,DAL,NYG,5,30,13.3,5.7,"Bryant faces a murder's row of opposing secondaries to begin his 2017 campaign, and will start off against the Giants. Bryant saw 14 targets in his two games against the Giants last season, but had only two catches for 18 yards. With little other help in the receiving game, the Giants will likely once again focus their attention on stopping Bryant on passing plays, though the fact that Ezekiel Elliott will play should ease the burden a bit. It's tough to sit one of the most talented receivers in the game, but with Janoris Jenkins again likely to shadow Bryant, fantasy owners should prepare themselves for a tough game in the opener."
12,Brandin Cooks,NE,KC,6,17,9.8,2.9,"In his first game with the Patriots on national TV, I'm expecting him to come out with a bang. The Chiefs have Marcus Peters who'll likely see the most of Cooks, and while he's solid, he's a risk taker. He can be burned for taking the wrong risks, and Cooks is the type of guy to make him bite. In New England, look for there to be fireworks. The best part about Cooks is that it just takes one play to pay off. "
13,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,LAC,5,25,14.4,4.1,"Thomas does not have any quarterback play to write home about, but he was consistent again last season nevertheless. The Chargers have a few solid pieces in their secondary, but nothing worthy of concern for Thomas or the Broncos' passing game."
14,Stefon Diggs,MIN,NO,8,29,14.8,4.2,"Diggs' issue has almost always been about his health, not his talent. Despite playing only 13 games last season, he ranked 14th in the NFL in catches with 84 and had the fifth-best catch rate (76 percent). He'll take on a Saints defense that allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and will be playing without their best cornerback, Delvin Breaux. The circumstances are ripe for a big game for Diggs, making him a WR2 with plenty of upside."
15,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,JAC,7,32,15.1,5.1,"Hopkins finished as the #37 wide receiver in fantasy football last season despite playing the whole year. Tom Savage starting does not help the situation, nor does a terrific Jaguars' secondary. Still, he ought to be started in all standard leagues because of the upside he possesses."
16,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,PHI,8,38,15.8,5.5,"Pryor struggled with drops this preseason, leading some to worry about his viability as a number-two fantasy receiver this season. But he gets a relatively soft matchup to start off 2017, facing off against the Eagles at home. Philadelphia allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and Kirk Cousins threw for two touchdowns in each game against them in 2016. With DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon gone, targets will need to go somewhere, and Pryor should be the beneficiary. He's got a decent shot to score a touchdown, and should be heavily targeted regardless."
17,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,SF,6,30,19.1,6.0,"Benjamin endured a lot of jokes about his weight at the beginning of the preseason, but his performance spoke for itself. Benjamin tallied eight catches for 107 yards and two touchdowns in the preseason, including one from Cam Newton on a two-yard slant. The 49ers allowed the 14th-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers last season, but that figure was largely inflated because the 49ers' rush defense was so atrocious that most offenses simply relied on the run. Even so, the San Francisco defense allowed 21 touchdowns to wide receivers last season, second-most in the league, and the red zone is where Benjamin is likely to do most of his damage. He makes a solid option in Week 1."
18,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,WAS,11,34,19.1,4.3,"Jeffery gets an immediate test with his new team, as he'll almost certainly be shadowed by Josh Norman in the opener. While that's a daunting task, Jeffery and Norman faced off in Week 16 last season when he the former was with the Bears, and he caught five of 10 targets for 92 yards with Matt Barkley throwing him the ball. Given the Eagles' depth in the receiving game and Jeffery's past success against Norman, he makes a fine WR2 play, as he looks to make a good first impression with his new team."
19,Golden Tate,DET,ARI,11,33,20.3,4.6,"Tate is coming off his third straight season of at least 90 catches and four touchdowns, and became heavily involved in the offense last season after a slow start. The Cardinals struggled against wide receivers last season, allowing the fourth-most fantasy points to the position. But with Tyrann Mathieu back and looking healthy, and likely guarding Tate, the young wide receiver may have a difficult time producing in this one. "
20,Keenan Allen,LAC,DEN,10,34,20.6,5.3,"Prior to Allen's injury two years ago, he was on pace for 180 targets and 1,500 receiving yards. The main knock on him this summer was health, but so long as he remains on the field, he should be started in every game, even against a unit like Denver."
21,Martavis Bryant,PIT,CLE,7,39,20.9,5.9,"Bryant was superb two years ago when he was on the field, even splitting targets with Antonio Brown. There is no reason to expect change this season, especially in Week 1 in a matchup against the lowly Browns."
22,T.Y. Hilton,IND,LAR,7,40,23.4,7.4,"You need to consider benching Hilton with Andrew Luck out of the lineup. It's not the easiest thing to do when you likely spent a 2nd round pick on him, but in his 10 games without Luck have netted 63 yards per game with just two touchdowns. This game will also be on the road, which takes him away from the turf element that he succeeds on. "
23,Allen Robinson,JAC,HOU,10,41,24.0,5.8,"Houston's pass defense was among the best in football last season, but they lost A.J. Bouye, who stifled Robinson in Week 15. Blake Bortles isn't a great quarterback by any means, however, but with the volume Robinson should see this year, he is startable every single week."
24,Sammy Watkins,LAR,IND,12,41,24.2,6.1,"I guess we'll see just how quick the Goff/Watkins connection can happen, as they have the dream matchup in Week 1 against the Colts talent-deficient secondary. Vontae Davis has shown flashes before, but that player wasn't found very often in 2016. At the very least, Watkins should be considered a strong WR2 in this game. "
25,Davante Adams,GB,SEA,10,43,24.6,5.8,"Adams had a breakout 2016, with 997 yards and 12 touchdowns, and looks ready to continue to build on his success. Unfortunately, he gets an extremely tough matchup in Week 1 against a tough Seattle defense. The Packers made it a point last season to keep Jordy Nelson away from Richard Sherman, which likely means that Adams will draw the unenviable task of trying to beat one of the best cornerbacks in the league. If you drafted Adams, you're probably starting him, but expectations should be tempered in this one."
26,Tyreek Hill,KC,NE,13,35,21.8,4.8,"Hill will have several big games this season, but it is unlikely one comes against Belichek's Patriots, who have been known to shut down gimmicky players like Hill. He is expected to see more carries this year, but probably no more than 8 touches altogether."
27,Pierre Garcon,SF,CAR,10,38,25.2,5.6,"Garcon is coming off an excellent season with the Redskins, hauling in 79 receptions for 1,041 yards and three touchdowns. He now joins the 49ers and their Kyle Shanahan-led offensive scheme as the No. 1 wide receiver. The Panthers struggled against wide receivers in 2016, giving up the seventh-most fantasy points to the position, and allowing at least one wide receiver to score at least 14.5 PPR points in 13 of their last 15 games. The 49ers will likely need points in this one, so Brian Hoyer should be throwing a lot and peppering Garcon with targets. That makes Garcon no worse than a WR3 in the opener, with plenty of upside for more."
28,Emmanuel Sanders,DEN,LAC,14,37,27.1,5.2,"The Chargers have a superb pass rush, but the Broncos' offensive line is much improved so Semien won't be on his toes quite as much as you might expect. Sanders can be inconsistent from week to week, but his upside is enough that you can't justify benching him."
29,Brandon Marshall,NYG,DAL,13,54,27.7,6.5,"Marshall gets a solid matchup in his first game with his new team, taking on a revamped Dallas secondary that is easily beatable. While Marshall had an awful season in 2016, few could succeed with any of the Jets' quarterbacks throwing him the ball. He's still always involved at the goal-line, ranking seventh or higher among wide receivers in end zone targets in nine of the past 10 years. His value in the opener is highly dependent on whether Odell Beckham Jr. plays, as he'll vault immediately into the WR2 discussion if Beckham sits. If he plays, then Marshall is still a WR3, as he has a good chance of finding the end zone in this one."
30,Jamison Crowder,WAS,PHI,10,41,27.9,6.3,"Crowder had success last season before tailing off toward the end as DeSean Jackson came on. Overall, he finished with 67 catches for 847 yards and seven touchdowns. With both Jackson and Pierre Garcon out the door, Crowder remains one of Kirk Cousins' only familiar targets, which should once again lead to good things in 2017. In a solid matchup in Week 1 against Patrick Robinson, the Eagles' slot cornerback, Crowder is firmly in the WR3 territory to start the season."
31,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,CIN,13,48,30.2,5.5,"Flacco has not thrown a pass all pre-season, but he did lead the NFL in pass attempts each of the past two seasons, so you've got to start his #1 receiver, especially when it is a man who averaged 8 touchdowns per season over his last five healthy years."
32,Adam Thielen,MIN,NO,19,47,31.7,6.0,"Thielen broke out last season, catching 69 passes for 967 yards and five scores. Now he'll move to the slot role, where he should be heavily involved in the passing game nearly every week. The Saints struggled against wide receivers last season, allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to the position, and they're down top cornerback Delvin Breaux. That should lead to plenty of production for Thielen, who makes a fine WR3."
33,Eric Decker,TEN,OAK,12,47,33.0,5.2,"Decker is a bonafide touchdown machine and if he can stay on the field, should be started each and every week. Oakland has one of the easiest secondaries to pass on, so he could very well finish as a WR1 this week if the chips fall right,"
34,Ted Ginn,NO,MIN,22,55,36.9,7.3,"As he was in Carolina the last two seasons, Ginn will be a boom-or-bust option this season with the Saints. The Vikings are incredibly tough on opposing wide receivers, allowing just 2105 receiving yards to the position last season, second-best in the NFL. But no matter the matchup, Ginn always represents a home run threat. Willie Snead's absence probably doesn't matter all that much with Ginn, as his role will remain the more or less the same. Thus, Ginn remains a boom-or-bust WR3 or 4, and it just depends on how much risk you're willing to take."
35,Randall Cobb,GB,SEA,25,52,36.7,6.1,"Once a trendy breakout player, Cobb's fantasy stock has taken a nosedive with a dismal 2016 campaign, which saw him tally just 60 receptions for 610 yards and four touchdowns. A matchup against a tough Seattle defense in Week 1 isn't what his owners want to see, but it may not be quite as bad as it seems. With major attention likely to be given to Davante Adams and Jordy Nelson, Cobb could find success in the slot role, where he plays in over 80 percent of his snaps. Cobb had only three receptions for 33 yards against the Seahawks last season, but hauled in all of his targets. While owners shouldn't be excited to start Cobb here, he should find at least some success, despite the tough matchup."
36,Kenny Britt,CLE,PIT,21,64,38.8,6.5,"Britt should be the #1 in this offense while he is healthy, but DeShone Kizer was turnover prone in college and now he is being thrown into the fire as just a 21-year-old. It should be ugly for this pass attack in Week 1."
37,Mike Wallace,BAL,CIN,32,50,39.6,3.7,"Wallace has been as reliable as they come for season long scoring, but he is streaky from week to week. You can't afford a 2 point performance, but you'll kick yourself if he goes off for 25. Our bet is on the bust, as Flacco hasn't even taken a snap this preseason yet."
38,John Brown,ARI,DET,26,63,39.7,5.9,"Brown shot up draft boards with his two-touchdown performance against the Falcons this preseason, but draws a tough matchup in the opener. Although the Lions allow their fair share of fantasy points to wide receivers (sixth-most in the league in 2016), Brown should be matched up against Darius Slay, making it tough sledding for the quick wide receiver. But his explosiveness always makes him a risk to go off on any given Sunday, and he makes a decent upside play in the first game of the season."
39,Rishard Matthews,TEN,OAK,24,59,40.4,7.3,"Corey Davis will be used only sparingly in Week 1 because of the injury he is battling through. That means Matthews will see most of the snaps, and we saw last year what he can do in this offense."
40,Chris Hogan,NE,KC,16,71,39.2,10.3,"With Edelman gone, there is no doubt that Hogan will get extra targets, but the floor is still plenty low so it is not advised that you toss him into your starting lineup from the get-go, as he may play fifth fiddle behind Cooks, Gronk, Mitchell and even Amendola."
41,Corey Coleman,CLE,PIT,22,50,41.5,5.2,"Coleman has shown flashes of brilliance early in his career, but even against a volatile Steelers defense, we are talking about a 21-year old quarterback making his debut, so it isn't adviseable to start Coleman quite yet."
42,Tyrell Williams,LAC,DEN,32,57,41.7,5.8,"Williams came on extremely strong last season, but now he takes a back seat to target hog Keenan Allen, and the matchup certainly won't help either. Denver has the best secondary in football, so this is the one week where benching Williams will make sense."
43,Kevin White,CHI,ATL,22,55,42.1,5.9,"Cameron Meredith's injury opens the door wide open for White, who has appeared in only four games over his first two seasons because of injury. There's no doubting his athleticism, and he's in line for a high number of targets for so long as he stays healthy. The Bears should be throwing early and often on Sunday to try to keep pace with the Falcons offense, and that will lead to at least the opportunity for White to make plays on Sunday. Whether he actually does is anybody's guess. With a strong matchup and expected shootout, White makes for an intriguing play both in season-long leagues and DFS."
44,Marvin Jones,DET,ARI,27,55,43.4,6.4,"Jones started hot last season before fading into oblivion over the second half, as Golden Tate became more and more involved in the offense. He remains the number-two option in the receiving game behind Tate, but draws a tough matchup against a strong Arizona secondary. It's likely that Jones will draw Patrick Peterson in the opener, making him no more than a WR4."
45,Jordan Matthews,BUF,NYJ,29,68,43.6,6.2
46,Donte Moncrief,IND,LAR,26,58,43.6,6.9,"Moncrief will be startable virtually every week that Andrew Luck is in the lineup, especially against teams like the Rams, but with Tolzein under center, there is not much of a case to be made to his defense."
47,Sterling Shepard,NYG,DAL,26,70,44.8,6.9,"At the end of last season, optimism was high for Shepard's prospects in 2017, as he scored six touchdowns in his final nine games. But the arrival of Brandon Marshall certainly hurt Shepard's outlook this season, as did his training camp injuries. The Cowboys' revamped secondary is not strong, and Shepard should see enough targets to have a solid fantasy day if Odell Beckham Jr. sits out the opener with an ankle injury. If Beckham plays, however, targets may be a bit hard to come by for Shepard, making him no better than a WR4 option."
48,Kendall Wright,CHI,ATL,22,77,47.2,9.7,"Wright went from a fantasy afterthought to a late-round target, especially in PPR leagues, after Cameron Meredith's season-ending injury. The Falcons' pass defense is somewhat suspect, and they allowed the ninth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers in 2016. With Mike Glennon likely to air it out on Sunday, Wright and Kevin White figure to see a large number of targets in the opener. Wright's upside is limited, so he's far more of a sneaky DFS play than a solid season-long fantasy option in Week 1."
49,Zay Jones,BUF,NYJ,34,64,48.2,6.5,"Jordan Matthews is banged up and Sammy Watkins is gone, so believe it or not, this is the Zay Jones show for Week 1. What's more is that it is against a dreadful defense so the Bills offense just might score a few TDs even if Nathan Peterman is under center."
50,Robby Anderson,NYJ,BUF,28,70,48.4,8.0,"Many don't realize just how fast Anderson is, but he ran a 4.30 forty yard dash in the combine which is blazing for a 6'3"" wideout. Last season, he saw 78 targets as a rookie despite starting just 8 games. It is possible now that he is the head dog that he sees 140+ targets as the Jets play catch-up in the majority of their games. If that happens, we are looking at a potential top 24 wide receiver with over 1,000 receiving yards."
51,Cole Beasley,DAL,NYG,37,71,49.4,5.7,"With Zeke out of the lineup for up to six weeks, the Cowboys may end up throwing the ball quite a bit more than they did last season. Dez is far and away the #1, but with a schedule filled with top-flight cornerbacks, Dak Prescott may be throwing away from the situation into targets like Beasley, who has been the darling of Cowboys camp. In PPR leagues especially, he is a safe flex play if you are in need of one."
52,Corey Davis,TEN,OAK,23,78,52.9,9.0
53,Cooper Kupp,LAR,IND,23,74,53.5,9.8,"Sammy Watkins is now in town and Tavon Austin will soak up plenty of touches as well, but Kupp has been displaying this pre-season that he belongs in the heart of the gameplan as well. This possession style receiver is polished and should see enough targets to be considered a safe play from Week 1 for teams in need of a handful of points any given week. His upside is limited, however."
54,Marqise Lee,JAC,HOU,42,73,53.9,5.7
55,Paul Richardson,SEA,GB,34,78,55.3,8.6,"Richardson wasn't on many fantasy players' radars entering the preseason, but he became a trendy sleeper pick as we got deeper into August. He worked ahead of Jermaine Kearse for most of the preseason, and Kearse's trade to the Jets thrust Richardson into the No. 2 role with Tyler Lockett recovering from an injury. Lockett looks like he will be active for Week 1 against the Packers, which certainly hurts Richardson's value a bit, though Lockett will likely be on a snap count. But the Packers were terrible against the pass in 2016, allowing 3011 yards receiving and the second-most fantasy points to wide receivers. While injuries were largely to blame, the Packers' secondary is still quite beatable, making Richardson an intriguing DFS play who  can be had for almost nothing."
56,Tyler Lockett,SEA,GB,40,74,55.3,5.2,"Lockett sat out the entire preseason, but has been practicing since early August. Pete Carroll stated that Lockett will take on his usual role in Week 1 against the Packers, but Paul Richardson is listed as the No. 2 receiver on the Seahawks' depth chart. It's unlikely that Lockett will get a full workload in his first game action of the season, so it's almost impossible to rely on him with any confidence. Still, the Packers were awful against wide receivers last year, allowing a league-leading 26 touchdowns. Because of his likely limited work, Lockett is mostly a desperation play, but the matchup makes the thought of starting him palatable."
57,Torrey Smith,PHI,WAS,40,79,58.1,8.4,"Smith had a rough two-year stint with the 49ers, totaling just 53 receptions for 930 yards and seven touchdowns over 28 games played. The Eagles signed him to a three-year deal, hoping to see more of his old form. The Redskins were middle of the road against opposing wide receivers last season, but with Josh Norman likely shadowing Alshon Jeffery, Carson Wentz will need someone else to throw the ball to. There's no way to start Smith with any degree of confidence in the first game, but don't be surprised if he finds a way to be productive."
58,Taylor Gabriel,ATL,CHI,41,75,56.5,5.6,"Gabriel defines the phrase ""big-play threat,"" and showed he was capable of doing a lot with limited snaps in 2016, tallying 579 yards receiving and six touchdowns last season. While he should have a handful of big games this season, it's not overwhelmingly likely that one of them will be this week in Chicago. Though Gabriel's stats were similar at home and on the road last season and the Bears secondary is nothing to write home about, it's unlikely that the Falcons will need any home run plays to easily win this game. As he usually will, Gabriel makes for a boom-or-bust play on Sunday, and you can't rely on him with any degree of confidence."
59,Danny Amendola,NE,KC,38,88,60.2,11.8,"When Julian Edelman went down, most figured Hogan would take over his role entirely, but Amendola fits the mold much closer. He has had spurts in his injury riddled career where he was a solid possession receiver. Perhaps in Brady's offense, he could play that role up to par with what Edelman has done. We will know much more after Week 1, so until then, it doesn't hurt to add just in case he breaks out."
60,Mohamed Sanu,ATL,CHI,39,78,61.6,8.3,"Coming off a disappointing 2016 campaign that saw him tally just 653 receiving yards and four touchdowns, the bloom is off the rose for Sanu, who is nothing more than a possession receiver. Although the Bears secondary is easily beatable, Sanu will get the toughest matchup of all the Falcons receivers, facing off against steady Bryce Callahan in the slot. With little upside, Sanu simply is not a viable play in Week 1."
61,Devin Funchess,CAR,SF,47,87,61.2,6.1,"Cam Newton may end up missing a few weeks, but when the former MVP returns, Funchess will be waiting in the starting lineup. This is a kid who has produced with the limited targets he has seen and actually been more efficient than Kelvin Benjamin. Funchess has been a touchdown rate monster and fantasy owners could hit the jackpot if he ends up with 100 targets including 15-20 in the red zone."
62,Breshad Perriman,BAL,CIN,48,89,62.6,8.1,"We haven't seen much from Perriman at this point in his career, but we do know he has the rare speed/size combo that NFL teams drool over. After the Ravens acquired Jeremy Maclin, the hype on Perriman quickly faded, but the matter of the fact is that the Ravens lost a ton of targets from last season when Steve Smith, Dennis Pitta and Kamar Aiken all left. With Perriman's athletic profile, there is plenty of upside if enough of Flacco's league leading attempts end up going his way."
63,Chris Conley,KC,NE,42,84,64.3,7.4,"Belichek is known for doing what it takes to stop an opponent's top talent, so Tyreek Hill should take a step backward in Week 1, which could mean more of Conley, who is a freak athlete himself. This is supposed to be a high-scoring game as well."
64,Robert Woods,LAR,IND,35,78,64.9,7.6
65,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,BUF,38,94,68.7,11.0
66,J.J. Nelson,ARI,DET,52,75,63.5,5.5,"With John Brown healthy, Nelson will occupy his usual boom-or-bust status in the fantasy community most weeks, including Week 1 against the Lions. Detroit generally struggles against the pass, and Carson Palmer will likely be throwing quite a bit in this one in what should be a high-scoring affair. But Nelson is just as likely to go without a catch as he is to have a big day, making him a risky play Sunday."
67,Terrance Williams,DAL,NYG,45,86,67.4,7.7
68,Brandon Coleman,NO,MIN,51,96,67.4,8.6,"Coleman is probably the biggest beneficiary of the Willie Snead suspension, as Michael Thomas would always be the featured receiver and Ted Ginn will continue to occupy his boom-or-bust role. But without Snead, Coleman should step into the slot role. Coleman's size makes him far from a typical slot receiver, but the Saints will likely look to use him as they did Marques Colston, which always led to fantasy production. The Vikings pass defense is elite, but with most of the attention being paid to Thomas, Coleman may be able to find some room in the middle of the defense. He's not a starting option in fantasy leagues at this point, but could make for a dirt-cheap DFS play."
69,Marquise Goodwin,SF,CAR,54,87,69.5,9.8
70,Brandon LaFell,CIN,BAL,47,80,67.7,6.7
71,Tyler Boyd,CIN,BAL,47,82,67.9,7.0
72,Josh Doctson,WAS,PHI,54,79,67.7,6.4,"The Redskins drafted Doctson last year to take over for DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon at the top of the depth chart when they would inevitably leave. We weren't able to see whether he could live up to the expectations last season, and they did add Terrelle Pryor, but the matter of the fact is that he is still oozing with talent and has the potential to break out. These are the types of players worth adding rather than a backup tight end or QB."
73,Tavon Austin,LAR,IND,53,92,74.2,7.9,"Tavon is non-existent in a good 80% of fantasy games, but that was under the Jeff Fisher regime. Now that Sean McVay is in town, Austin may finally see all of his athletic ability utilized. We are not suggesting pick him up to play right away, but as a gamble that might pay off in a big way down the road."

76,Allen Hurns,JAC,HOU,51,97,75.3,10.3
77,Kenny Golladay,DET,ARI,54,86,71.7,6.5,"We've seen glimpses of why the Lions were so confident in Golladay to draft him a few rounds earlier than he was projected. It is entirely possible that he fills the void left by Anquan Boldin as the top red zone threat in the offense. If he does, there is quite a bit of upside, but that would mean Marvin Jones would be seeing less snaps so Golladay has some work to do first to get to that point."
