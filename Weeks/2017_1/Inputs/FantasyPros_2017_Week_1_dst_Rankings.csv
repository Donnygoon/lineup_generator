Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Houston Texans,HOU,JAC,1,11,1.4,1.3,"This game in Houston should be a slugfest with low scores and turnovers galore. Bortles has been known to pass touchdowns to the opposing team, and with a healthy JJ Watt, the Texans are the clear-cut top option of the week."
2,Denver Broncos,DEN,LAC,1,13,3.4,2.1,"With the Denver secondary and pass rush both being among the top handful of teams in the league, they ought to be started in every single matchup. Phillip Rivers is a turnover machine, so even though they might score 20+ points, a few turnovers would make them a top unit once again."
3,Pittsburgh Steelers,PIT,CLE,1,13,4.3,2.5,"The Steelers don't have the most talent of any defense, but they have enough to be competent, and much more so against a schedule like they will see over the first five weeks. In Week 1 they draw the Browns, followed by the Vikings, Bears, Ravens and Blake Bortles in weeks 2-5. They should be owned in all leagues until this run of games is complete."
4,Carolina Panthers,CAR,SF,2,17,5.3,2.4,"The Panthers DST was unremarkable in 2016, but they brought back Julius Peppers to go along with a strong linebacker group and veteran pass rush. The 49ers allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing DSTs last season, though they should rank better this year after hiring head coach Kyle Shanahan. Still, the Panthers should get enough sacks and turnovers in this one to make the DST a viable starting option in Week 1. "
5,Los Angeles Rams,LA,IND,1,21,5.2,3.3,"Whatever your opinion is of the Rams DST, there's no denying that it is one of the top options in Week 1. With Andrew Luck sidelined, Scott Tolzien will be at the helm for the Colts. Tolzien has thrown seven interceptions to just two touchdowns in his career, making him an easy choice to stream against. With Wade Phillips calling the signals, expect a big week from the DST."
6,Buffalo Bills,BUF,NYJ,1,21,7.9,4.9,"The Jets have one of the worst offenses we have seen in quite some time. While the Bills are clearly tanking this season and lost several key defensive pieces, they should be expected to keep the score low and notch a turnover or two in the process."
7,New England Patriots,NE,KC,1,19,6.5,2.9,"When the Patriots get up, opposing teams have to pass to catch up, which provides loads of sack and turnover opportunities. Although Alex Smith is not turnover prone, the Pats should be started in all formats."
8,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,HOU,2,21,8.6,3.7,"The Jaguars had a stout defense to close last season, then went and added two all-world players to their unit. There is a chance that they enter the elite defense conversation with Houston, Denver and Seattle. Even better, the Jags travel to Houston for Week 1 where Tom Savage awaits. A shutout could be in storeso if you need a Week 1 streamer, add them quickly and cross your fingers for the long term upside."
9,Atlanta Falcons,ATL,CHI,2,22,8.9,2.5,"With Mike Glennon at the helm for the Bears, the Falcons DST makes a prime choice for fantasy owners in Week 1. Due to his lack of mobility, Glennon has been sacked 56 times in 19 games. With Cameron Meredith out for the season, the Bears are bound to be one dimensional, allowing the Falcons to focus on taking away Jordan Howard and forcing Glennon to try to move the ball through the air. That's a recipe for disaster for the Bears, and makes the Falcons DST one of the most enticing plays of the week."
10,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,DET,4,25,9.3,3.0,"The Cardinals have been a top-six DST in each of the past four seasons, and there's no reason for that trend to end now. The Lions aren't the best matchup now that Jim Bob Cooter is running the offense, allowing the 12th-fewest fantasy points to opposing DSTs in 2016. But absent a matchup against the Patriots, you're likely never sitting an elite unit like the Cardinals DST, and shouldn't do it in Week 1 absent being in an extremely shallow league."
11,Seattle Seahawks,SEA,GB,2,29,11.6,4.1,"The Seahawks DST should once again be one of the top fantasy options, but they get one of the toughest matchups in the game in Week 1 against the Packers in Green Bay. The Packers, unsurprisingly, allowed the eight-fewest fantasy points to opposing DSTs, as Aaron Rodgers rarely turns the ball over. If you drafted the Seahawks DST, you're likely starting them regardless of the matchup. But to the extent you have another option, Week 1 is likely the time to use it."
12,Los Angeles Chargers,LA,DEN,6,25,12.8,2.7,"Bosa and Ingram are the best defensive end combo in the NFL, and while Denver improved their offensive line, they are still prone to sacks. Semien isn't necessarily the best decision maker either so they could notch a few turnovers on top of the sacks."
13,Minnesota Vikings,MIN,NO,5,28,13.3,3.5,"The Vikings DST was second-best in 2016, and it should once again challenge for a top-five ranking. Between a solid secondary and a strong pass rush, the defense should produce plenty of sacks and turnovers. The Saints are an extremely tough matchup for DSTs, allowing the seventh-fewest points in 2016. But in a nationally-televised game at home on Monday night, the defense should be ready to play, making the DST a startable fantasy option in Week 1."
14,Cincinnati Bengals,CIN,BAL,4,21,13.9,3.8,"Typically, a mediocre defense wouldn't be recommended against an offense like Baltimore's, but their starting running back is out for the season, their top wide receiver left, their tight end retired, and Joe Flacco hasn't played a snap all pre-season. That is a strong recipe for the opposition."
15,New York Giants,NYG,DAL,4,28,14.0,3.6,"The Cowboys are a nightmare matchup for opposing DSTs, as they allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to the position in 2016, behind only the Falcons and the Patriots. With their incredible offensive line, the Cowboys focus on milking the clock and playing conservatively, which leads to few opportunities for turnovers and sacks. The Giants DST should again remain a formidable unit, but they don't make a great play for Week 1 in Dallas."
16,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,CIN,5,24,15.3,2.6
17,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,WAS,5,27,16.5,3.5
18,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,NE,6,30,17.7,4.3
19,Green Bay Packers,GB,SEA,9,25,18.6,2.6,"The Packers defense should be ready to roll in front of an excited crowd in Week 1, but the DST is unlikely to do that much against the Seahawks. Seattle was middle of the road against opposing DSTs last season, and they once again have one of the worst offensive lines in football. But, unlike most of last season, Russell Wilson is currently healthy, and his mobility and smart decision-making should likely keep sacks and turnovers at a minimum here. There will certainly be times where the Packers DST makes a solid starting option, but Week 1 is not one of them."
