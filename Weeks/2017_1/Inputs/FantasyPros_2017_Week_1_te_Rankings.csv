Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Greg Olsen,CAR,SF,1,7,3.2,1.6,"With Ted Ginn gone, Olsen is going to see some of the bigger plays in this offense. Not that he needs them, because he's always among the league leaders at tight end in yards per reception, but it's an added positive to him this year. When he matched up against San Francisco last year, Olsen burned them for 122 yards and a touchdown on just eight targets. It was a top-15 performance among all tight ends last year. "
2,Rob Gronkowski,NE,KC,1,6,1.6,1.5,"Why does Gronk have to get his toughest matchup of the year in Week 1? Seriously, Andy Reid's defense has shut down tight ends over the last two years, allowing the 7th fewest fantasy points to tight ends last year, and the least amount of fantasy points to them in 2015. With that being said, you aren't benching Gronk for anyone. He defies all logic when he's on the field and gives you an advantage. If anything, limit your exposure to him in DFS for this week. "
3,Jimmy Graham,SEA,GB,1,8,4.3,1.7,"Of the 31 passing scores the Packers allowed last year, just five of them went to tight ends. Still, Graham is one of the healthy options among the Seahawks pass catchers, making him enticing. It is a bit concerning that he totaled just one catch for 16 yards against them last year, but I'm still trotting him out in fantasy leagues. "
4,Jordan Reed,WAS,PHI,1,11,5.0,2.7,"If Reed is on the field, you have to play him, plain and simple. He comes with plenty of risk, but what tight end not named Rob Gronkowski, Travis Kelce, or Greg Olsen doesn't? Over the last two years, he's ranked No. 2 and No. 3 in terms of fantasy points per game at the position, and he's one of the only bodies left in the passing game that Kirk Cousins knows very well. The Eagles were solid against tight ends last year, allowing just 414 yards to them (lowest in the NFL), but again, you didn't draft Reed to leave him on your bench when he's healthy. "
5,Zach Ertz,PHI,WAS,2,10,5.5,2.0,"Although the Eagles have plenty of pass-catching options, Ertz should get a ton of targets in the Week 1 game against Washington. The Redskins allowed 1100 receiving yards and 106 receptions to tight ends last season, and allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to the position. Even if he doesn't find the end zone, a problem for Ertz throughout his career, the volume of work he should get against the Redskins should lead him to be one of the most valuable tight ends in the first week."
6,Travis Kelce,KC,NE,1,7,3.3,1.4,"So it's Gronk versus Mini-Gronk on opening night? This should be fun to watch, as Kelce is someone who came into his own last year. After seeing just 5.9 targets per game for the first 38 games of his career, the Chiefs let him loose over the final 10 games of 2016 when he averaged 8.2 targets. With Jeremy Maclin out of the lineup (he's in Baltimore now), Kelce averaged 6.2 receptions for 90.6 yards over the last two years. "
7,Delanie Walker,TEN,OAK,2,12,6.4,2.0,"Walker may be getting up there in age, and the Titans did acquire a touchdown machine in Eric Decker and future star in Davis, but Davis is banged up and the Raiders are the worst team in football at defending the tight end. He is a must start this week."
8,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,NO,2,14,6.8,2.4,"If we learned anything about the Vikings offense under Pat Shurmer last year, it's that both him and Sam Bradford want to target Rudolph a lot. "
9,Tyler Eifert,CIN,BAL,3,13,8.7,2.0,"When Eifert is healthy, he scores touchdowns. He has 18 to his name in the last 21 games he was on the field. It could happen again at home this Sunday. He remains a must start unless he is on the injury report."
10,Jason Witten,DAL,NYG,7,14,9.6,1.6,"The ageless Witten remains fantasy relevant this season, and particularly in the Cowboys' Week 1 matchup against the Giants. In his last five games against them, he has averaged 8.8 targets, 6.2 receptions, 51 yards, and 0.6 touchdowns. The Cowboys again neglected to add to their receiving group, leaving Witten as one of the team's most prolific pass-catchers. With a very shaky defense, the Cowboys are likely going to need some points to keep up with the Giants, and Witten should put up his typical solid line against the G-Men."
11,Martellus Bennett,GB,SEA,7,18,11.2,2.1,"Bennett, like all players on the Packers offense, draws a tough matchup in Week 1 against Seattle, as the Seahawks allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends in 2016. There's always some reason for optimism when Aaron Rodgers is involved, as the Packers' many weapons necessarily means that someone will have to find the soft spot in the defense, even one as good as Seattle's. But Rodgers has a history of largely ignoring his tight ends, and although Bennett is talented, it's unclear how much he'll factor into the gameplan, especially in Week 1. At such a barren position, Bennett is probably still a borderline start, despite the tough matchup."
12,Eric Ebron,DET,ARI,8,22,13.9,3.0,"Ebron could not have asked for a worse way to begin the 2017 season, as the Cardinals were by far the best defense against tight ends in 2016. They allowed just two touchdowns and 47 receptions all season, and there is no reason to expect them to be any less stingy in 2017. Ebron makes an intriguing play for the season, but he'll have a tough time finding success against the Cardinals. "
13,Hunter Henry,LAC,DEN,9,21,14.1,2.8,"Henry was unbelievably efficient last season as a rookie, and while he may be expected to see nearly twice as many targets this year, that doesn't make him an automatic start against a lock down defense like Denver has."
14,Coby Fleener,NO,MIN,10,24,14.7,2.9,"With Willie Sneed being suspended for three games, many are pointing to Ginn as the primary beneficiary, but when Sneed was out last year, Fleener had his best game of the year. He surged late in the season as the player we drafted Fleener to be, and if he can carry that into this season, he will be well worth owning for more than just the first three weeks."
15,Jack Doyle,IND,LAR,8,30,15.9,4.1,"While Doyle might not be injured, his ticket to relevance is. Until Andrew Luck returns, there is no sense in starting Doyle unless you are in a two tight end league. He is touchdown dependant and the Colts just won't score much in Luck's abscence."
16,C.J. Fiedorowicz,HOU,JAC,11,33,16.4,4.0
17,Charles Clay,BUF,NYJ,10,29,16.7,3.5,"The Bills dealt Sammy Watkins away, and while they did acquire Jordan Matthews, there are plenty of targets to go around. Clay began to get more and more work toward the end of the season and showed that he can help the offense. Until Zay Jones gets in full step with the offense and Matthews' health is 100%, Clay may just end up leading this Bills team in targets early on."
18,Austin Hooper,ATL,CHI,11,26,18.2,3.4,"Typically, rookie tight ends don't make much, if any noise in the passing game. It generally takes a few years for that part of their game to develop, but last year, Hooper was among the most efficient tight ends in all of football. When you add that to the fact that he is now a starter in what is one of the best offensive schemes in football for a tight end, it makes him a major breakout candidate."
19,Evan Engram,NYG,DAL,12,28,19.2,4.1,"While nobody wants to rely on a rookie tight end in fantasy, Engram may be the3 exception, at least in Week 1. Even if Odell Beckham Jr. doesn't miss the game, the Cowboys allowed the most fantasy points, receptions, and yards to opposing tight ends last year. Engram may not be a focal point all season, but with a dream matchup in Week 1, he makes an intriguing sleeper play."

23,Jesse James,PIT,CLE,14,40,23.9,5.0
24,Dwayne Allen,NE,KC,15,36,25.2,4.9,"Allen will end up being a solid streaming play a handful of weeks, but is nowhere close to it in Week 1 against the Chiefs' stout tight end coverage."
