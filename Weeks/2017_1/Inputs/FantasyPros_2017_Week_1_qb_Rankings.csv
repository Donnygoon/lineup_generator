Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Aaron Rodgers,GB,SEA,1,7,2.4,1.4,"Sure, it's Seattle, but Rodgers has shown the ability to overcome tough matchups. This will be on his home turf. Just last year against the Seahawks, he threw for 246 yards and three touchdowns on just 23 pass attempts. "
2,Tom Brady,NE,KC,1,26,2.2,3.6,"On the opening night of the 2017 season, Brady and his new weapons will likely pull out some new tricks. This game is also in New England, so it's worth noting the Chiefs allowed 23.1 points per game on the road last year compared to just 16.0 at home. "
3,Russell Wilson,SEA,GB,1,8,3.9,1.6,"Did you see Green Bay's defense last year? If you did, you'd probably think I'm too low on Wilson. The concern is that Wilson seemingly always starts the season slow. It may just be a coincidence, but of his five Week 1 starts, he's never topped 18 fantasy points. In fact, he's topped 15 points just once. Oddly enough, though, he does average more fantasy points on the road. He's a QB1. "
4,Matt Ryan,ATL,CHI,1,9,4.0,1.8,"Last year's MVP should open up the season with a bang. The Bears front seven is much better than most realize, but their secondary is a problem. They don't have a cornerback to stop Julio Jones. In fact, they don't have a double-team that can stop him. "
5,Marcus Mariota,TEN,OAK,1,11,5.0,2.1,"Oakland struggled on pass defense last season, but they have a few playmakers in the secondary and Khalil Mack, who gets after the quarterback, so don't quite expect a walk in the park. With that said, he should perform above his season average in this game and is a must start."
6,Cam Newton,CAR,SF,1,13,6.9,2.4,"The concern here is that the Panthers take it easy on Newton, who missed almost the entire preseason while having discomfort in his shoulder. This should be a run-heavy script for the Panthers, but it's also one that projects a lot of points for them, which means you want their QB. There is limited upside here, but remember that Newton destroyed the 49ers last year for 353 yards and four touchdowns. He didn't have more than two passing touchdowns in any other game. "
7,Drew Brees,NO,MIN,3,13,7.3,2.2,"We all know the Brees road narrative, but it's somewhat overblown. The outdoor/indoor splits are more prevalent, and this game is taking place in a dome. With months to gameplan, have faith in Brees and Sean Payton. "
8,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,CLE,2,15,7.8,2.9,"This game will put the Ben struggles on the road narrative to the test. Last year he posted just 167 yards and no touchdowns against them on the road, but that was a very windy contest with snow. With a healthy Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell, and Martavis Bryant, I'm interested to see just how good this offense can be. He's a risky DFS play, but in redraft, it's unlikely you have a better option. "
9,Kirk Cousins,WAS,PHI,1,12,8.4,2.0,"A divisional game, Cousins and the Eagles are familiar with each other. Last year, Cousins totaled 263 yards and two touchdowns in the first meeting, and 234 yards with two touchdowns in the second meeting. The Eagles did add Ronald Darby to their somewhat weak secondary, which helps, but Cousins also has some new weapons to work with. "
10,Derek Carr,OAK,TEN,3,14,8.8,2.4,"The Titans are considered a team on the come-up, but they have a glaring weakness in their secondary, which is where Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree will be navigating through on Sunday. All eyes will be on Marshawn Lynch's return, but he'll have a tough time against the Titans front seven. Instead, bet on Carr and the passing game. "
11,Carson Palmer,ARI,DET,7,18,11.9,2.5,"If you are streaming quarterbacks, or especially if Andrew Luck is your #1, Palmer is a tremendous pickup because he goes against two lousy pass defenses to open the season in games at Detroit then Indianapolis. John Brown has looked healthy as well and don't forget just how hot Palmer was to finish 2016."
12,Matthew Stafford,DET,ARI,5,18,12.2,2.8,"The Cardinals lost four starters this offseason, but the biggest loss may have been to their run defense. If Tyrann Mathieu is back to the player he was pre-injury, he can essentially take away Golden Tate out of the slot. Patrick Peterson would take care of Marvin Jones, leaving Ameer Abdullah as the primary beneficiary. Most don't realize Stafford threw just one or zero touchdowns in seven of the final 10 games in 2016. "
13,Dak Prescott,DAL,NYG,7,18,12.7,1.9,"Although Prescott had a fine rookie season and looked dynamite this preseason, he couldn't ask for a much worse matchup in Week 1. The Giants were the second-stingiest fantasy defense against opposing quarterbacks last season, allowing an average of just 11 fantasy points per game and only 15 passing touchdowns to 17 interceptions. Prescott wasn't particularly successful against them last season either, throwing for only one touchdown and two interceptions, while averaging 196 passing yards per game. While Prescott's seasonal outlook is bright, Week 1 presents an extremely difficult matchup."
14,Eli Manning,NYG,DAL,8,21,14.7,2.9,"Manning had a disappointing 2016 fantasy campaign, and put up mediocre numbers against Dallas in the process, throwing for 400 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions in the teams' two matchups. The Giants offensive line remains horrendous, but the team added both Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram to the fold, giving Manning even more options to work with this season. More importantly for Week 1, the Cowboys' pass defense should be dramatically worse, as they no longer have Barry Church, Brandon Carr, or Morris Claiborne in their secondary. Manning isn't exciting, but with Odell Beckham Jr. looking likely to play, added weapons, and a beatable opposing secondary, he makes for a fine starting option in Week 1."
15,Sam Bradford,MIN,NO,7,20,14.9,2.5,"If you haven't seen the schedule for the Vikings yet, pull it open, take a look and have a good chuckle about how easy this season will be for Bradford. He is available in near every league, but could be the breakout performer of the year at the position seeing that he finally has a healthy offensive line and the same offensive coordinator for the first time in back-to-back years over his entire career."
16,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,NYJ,8,22,16.0,3.2
17,Andy Dalton,CIN,BAL,9,22,16.3,2.3,"Andy Dalton has never had a healthy AJ Green, healthy Tyler Eifert and stud three down running back like Joe Mixon. While his offensive line isn't as solid as last season, he could be the head of a high-powered offense that makes him startable even against a solid unit like the Ravens."
18,Carson Wentz,PHI,WAS,11,24,16.4,2.1,"Wentz was a trendy sleeper pick this preseason, with the additions of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, along with another year of development. Still, he has a long way to go before being considered a fantasy asset, as he had just one top-10 fantasy week in 2016. Against a Redskins defense that was average against quarterbacks in 2016 but allowed the seventh-most passing yards, Wentz makes an intriguing option in Week 1. Still, if you can, it is probably better to take a wait-and-see approach with the young gunslinger before inserting him into your starting lineup."
19,Philip Rivers,LAC,DEN,11,26,19.1,2.4,"Philip Rivers combined to complete just 38 of 76 attempts (50 percent) for 445 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions in the two games against the Broncos last year, good enough for finishes with 11.1 and 12.7 fantasy points. He finished as the QB22 and QB23 in those matchups. Consider him a risky QB2 while on the road against the Broncos. "
20,Alex Smith,KC,NE,16,26,20.4,2.0,"Smith was terrific in Week 1 last season and is playing in a game that is expected to be a shootout, but the Patriots generally force more turnovers than average, and if the Chiefs had their way, they'd avoid getting Smith 30+ passes so he is a sit outside of deeper leagues."
21,Brian Hoyer,SF,CAR,13,26,21.8,2.6,"Hoyer makes an intriguing option in two-QB leagues in Week 1, as he looked relatively solid in the preseason and was quietly effective last season with the Bears, through six touchdowns with zero interceptions and completing 67 percent of his passes. He now heads an offense that should look completely different from the disaster in 2016, as Kyle Shanahan is an offensive guru, and Pierre Garcon is on board. The Panthers allowed the 14th-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks in 2016, though that number is a bit deceiving, as Carolina struggled to stop the pass early before finding its form over the final eight weeks (holding all quarterbacks but one below 18 fantasy points). Hoyer is from a starter in most leagues, but certainly enters the QB2 discussion for Week 1."
22,Jared Goff,LAR,IND,15,27,22.7,2.7,"Things couldn't have gone much worse for Goff in his rookie season, as he threw just five touchdown passes and totaled a 63.6 passer rating. But the Rams have improved their offensive line, and added some juice to their receiving game with Sammy Watkins and Cooper Kupp.  The Colts allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks last season, and will be playing without Vontae Davis in the opener. Goff is still only an option in two-QB leagues, but his owners couldn't have asked for much more heading into Week 1."
23,Joe Flacco,BAL,CIN,18,27,22.8,2.2,"Flacco has promised he will play Week 1, but that doesn't mean he will be 100%. We haven't even seen him so it is much better to hold off until we see him get a few reps."
24,Trevor Siemian,DEN,LAC,18,27,22.5,2.1
25,DeShone Kizer,CLE,PIT,18,29,23.9,2.8
26,Blake Bortles,JAC,HOU,20,30,25.9,1.8,"Try not to laugh too long that you miss the point. Bortles may be entirely incompetent as an NFL quarterback, but that isn't the case as a fantasy quarterback. In fact, he still finished as a top 10 QB last year despite the shoulder injury and all of the pick sixes. He is still the starting quarterback and until he losses his job, the fantasy potential will be knocking at your door. "
27,Josh McCown,NYJ,BUF,20,30,28.3,1.9
28,Mike Glennon,CHI,ATL,22,30,26.3,1.8,"If you're relying on Glennon as your fantasy starter in Week 1, something probably went wrong in your draft. But although he had a rough preseason until the third game where he righted the ship a bit, Glennon has been serviceable for most of his career. He has a 30-to-15 TD/INT ratio and an 84.6 passer rating in his career. Serviceable might be enough to get by in this one, as the Falcons allowed the second-most fantasy points to quarterbacks last season, and Glennon and the Bears will undoubtedly need a ton of points. But without much in the way of receivers after Cameron Meredith's injury, Glennon is nothing more than a desperation play in two-QB leagues."
