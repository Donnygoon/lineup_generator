1,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,CLE,1,5,1.5,0.9,"The clear-cut RB1 for Week 1, Bell destroyed the Browns in Cleveland last year to the tune of 201 total yards and a touchdown. Don't worry about him not partaking in the preseason, as he knows the system very well and the Steelers are obviously going to ride him on the road. "
2,David Johnson,ARI,DET,1,3,1.7,0.5,"The 1B to Bell's 1A, Johnson has a phenomenal matchup in Week 1 against the Lions. They allowed 11 of 16 running backs to reach double digit fantasy points last year, and lost linebacker DeAndre Levy this offseason. They'll reportedly lean on rookie Jarrad Davis at middle linebacker, and it may take time for him to adjust to the speed of the NFL game. You don't need me to tell you why you're starting Johnson."
3,LeSean McCoy,BUF,NYJ,1,8,3.7,1.3,"There is a lot of uncertainty around the Bills this year, but this is one game you should be certain about using McCoy. If the Sean McDermott coaching regime wants to get off to a good start, giving McCoy the ball 20-plus times against the Jets would be a good move. They struggled more and more against the run as the season went on, allowing three 100-yard games over their final 11 games of 2016. "
4,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,NYG,2,14,5.4,2.4,"Elliott is still currently facing a six-game suspension, but he'll get to play in Week 1 while the courts determine his fate. It will be a bit of the irresistible force - the Cowboys' incredible offensive line - vs. the immovable object - a Giants run defense that allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to running backs in 2016. Elliott ""struggled"" against the Giants last season, tallying 20 carries for 51 yards and a score in the first meeting and 24 carries for 107 yards in the second. Those were down games by Elliott's standards, but owners who were expecting to be without Elliott for this one will gladly take him. He may not be the complete stud he usually is in this one, but he's a clear RB1, as he always should be regardless of the matchup."
5,Devonta Freeman,ATL,CHI,2,14,5.4,2.0,"The Bears front-seven is much better than most want to give them credit for, provided they are healthy, which they weren't in 2016. Still, Freeman is a running back who can get it done in a multitude of different ways, making him a safe play nearly every week. The game-script should be in his favor in this game, too. Locked into 15-plus touches, Freeman is an RB1 in Week 1. "
6,DeMarco Murray,TEN,OAK,1,11,6.3,2.2,"Provided he's healthy, Murray makes for one of the safer plays in Week 1. The Titans offense has a lot of new parts to it, which should bring lighter fronts for their run game. The Raiders have some solid parts to their front-seven, but were far from a lights out defense last year, allowing over 4.5 yards per carry and 18 total touchdowns to running backs. "
7,Todd Gurley,LAR,IND,3,13,6.5,2.2,"I've preached this offseason that Gurley is one of the few running backs who is locked into 300-plus touches this year and it starts in Week 1 against the Colts. The Rams will be at home against a defense that allowed over 4.8 yards per carry last year, including 17 total touchdowns to them. They added a bunch of mediocre talent to their front seven, but nothing to make a significant change to their outlook. If Andrew Luck sits this game out, you don't even have to worry about game-script. In fact, the Rams would likely win this game, making Gurley a lock into lineups. "
8,Melvin Gordon,LAC,DEN,3,13,8.4,1.9,"The Broncos appear to be a difficult matchup for Gordon, and they are to an extent, but they're easier on running backs than they are passing games. In his two games against the Broncos last year, Gordon totaled 50 carries for 205 rushing yards but didn't score. He's one of the few running backs in the league you can lock in for 15-plus touches every week, making him a top-15 option almost by default. "
9,Jordan Howard,CHI,ATL,4,17,8.7,2.9,"This will be a good measuring stick for Howard, as this is a game that the Bears likely have little chance of winning, even while at home. We should see Howard's involvement in the passing game, which was a large focus of the Bears offseason plans with the additions of Benny Cunningham and Tarik Cohen. The Falcons really struggled against any running back who saw more than 14 carries against them, as there were seven running backs to hit that mark, and all of them reached 14 PPR points, including six of them who hit 17 or more PPR points. Despite his question marks in the passing game, he should hit that mark in carries. "
10,Dalvin Cook,MIN,NO,5,19,11.1,2.7,"Perhaps no one did more this preseason to raise his stock than Cook, and he gets an excellent matchup on Monday Night Football in Week 1 against New Orleans. The Saints allowed the third-most points to running backs in 2016, including 23 total touchdowns. Latavius Murray is still a threat to steal goal-line work and Jerick McKinnon will be involved as well. But in a dream matchup and with plenty of preseason buzz, Cook makes a fantastic play in Week 1."
11,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,SF,8,27,12.6,3.7,"Regardless of how I feel about McCaffrey in the long run, he's an RB1 in his first NFL game. The Panthers will want to take it easy with Newton who is coming off shoulder surgery in Week 1, and the matchup couldn't fit them any better. The 49ers were a historically bad run defense last year, allowing 9 of the last 13 running backs who played against them to rush for 117 or more yards. The matchup could not be better for his first NFL game. "
12,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,PIT,8,28,12.8,3.8,"Pay attention to the offensive line prior to this game starting, as three of them were banged up throughout the preseason. If healthy, it's a top-five unit that'll be blocking for Crowell against the Steelers. We saw this matchup twice last year where Crowell finished with just 10 yards on eight carries in the first matchup, but then destroyed them for 168 total yards in their second matchup. If the line is healthy, you should expect somewhere in between these two performances. "
13,Lamar Miller,HOU,JAC,7,21,13.2,2.9,"This entire Jaguars defense is stout and would be danger for even the best offenses. Houston may just have the worst offense in football, so this is a nightmare scenario for Miller. He will get enough volume to be startable, but it should be a rough game to begin the season."
14,Carlos Hyde,SF,CAR,7,31,15.9,3.8,"Perhaps no player's draft stock bounced back and forth as much as Hyde's, who sounded on the verge of being traded, benched, and deployed as the 49ers' workhorse back at various times this preseason. But he's on the upswing now, and couldn't find himself in a better system, as the lead back in Kyle Shanahan's system that led to 43 touchdowns for running backs over the last two seasons. The Panthers defense is solid but unspectacular against the run (17th-most fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs in 2016), but Hyde's projected volume alone makes him a solid starting option in this one."
15,C.J. Anderson,DEN,LAC,8,25,16.5,3.6,"Some just assume the Chargers defense is bad because they kind of were for a long time, but this isn't the Chargers of 2015. They have an intense pass rush and two extremely solid cornerbacks in the secondary, so the Broncos would be wise to lean on Anderson this week. They built up their offensive line this offseason, so Anderson should be able to improve on his performance against them last year which included 71 total yards on 14 touches. "
16,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,TEN,10,30,17.3,3.9,"Jurrell Casey and friends are not easy to run against, plus the Titans pass defense is shakey at best, so Oakland should air it out more often this game. With that said, Lynch should be in line for 12+ carries and a few goal-line touches too."
17,Bilal Powell,NYJ,BUF,7,24,17.3,3.8,"Over his last four games when he was finally given the job, Powell had 542 yards and 21 receptions. One of those games was against this Bills defense and he torched them for over 140. Forte may be back, but this is the Bilal Powell show now and he could have another hey day on the ground and through the air for the Jets."
18,Leonard Fournette,JAC,HOU,10,28,17.9,4.5,"The Jaguars have said that they prefer to pass zero times per game. That obviously isn't doable, but you shouldn't be surprised if Fournette sees 25 touches in Week 1. Keep in mind, he is dealing with a foot injury so keep an eye on that injury status."
19,Ty Montgomery,GB,SEA,9,29,19.0,3.4,"With the Packers having officially determined that Montgomery is, indeed, a running back, the youngster steps into the lead role in the team's backfield. Unfortunately, he draws an incredibly stingy Seahawks defense which allowed the third-fewest fantasy points to running backs last season. But Montgomery had 44 receptions in 15 games last year, so it's a good bet that he'll be able to contribute to fantasy owners in some way, even if it's not a massive performance."
20,Kareem Hunt,KC,NE,9,40,16.2,5.5,"Andy Reid has come out and said that Kareem Hunt will get the bulk of the carries rather than some sort of time-share. Granted, New England isn't the easiest opponent to run against and this should be a negative game script, but so long as Hunt is expected for 15+ touches, he is a top 15 running back."
21,Mark Ingram,NO,MIN,9,31,21.4,3.6,"Ingram had a fine fantasy season in 2016, finishing ninth in the NFL with a 5.1 YPC average and finishing as a top-15 running back for the third straight year. Although Adrian Peterson will surely cut into his work, Ingram should be the primary ball carrier once again, and be successful. Minnesota presents a tough task in Week 1, as they allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs last year. There's also the revenge factor in this one, as the Saints will surely want Peterson to get some goal-line work against his former team, which lessens the chances of a touchdown for Ingram. Still, the Saints offense can beat any defense and Ingram should get the lion's share of the work, making him a fine RB2 play. "
22,Danny Woodhead,BAL,CIN,13,32,22.4,3.8,"Woodhead is 32 years old coming off a torn ACL and now he has a bum hamstring. He is going to attempt to play Week 1, but expect him to be limited, as he won't have seen enough reps with his new offense to be worked in fully. "
23,Ameer Abdullah,DET,ARI,14,49,23.9,5.7,"After a lost year in 2016 during which Abudallah sustained a season-ending injury in the second game of the season, the shifty running back looks ready to take the reins full-time. Theo Riddick will be involved in the passing game, but the Lions have made it clear that they want Abdullah to be their man in the running game. Unfortunately, Abdullah gets an incredibly difficult test to start the season, as he draws the Cardinals, which gave up the fewest fantasy points to running backs in 2016. Still, the Lions offense can hang with most defenses when it is at full strength, and Abdullah's skillset makes him a startable option in Week 1 despite the tough matchup. "
24,Tevin Coleman,ATL,CHI,11,37,26.0,4.7,"Coleman could probably be a fantasy stud if he landed on a team where he was the featured back, but he'll have to settle playing second fiddle to Devonta Freeman. There are far worse places to be, however, as the Atlanta offense should once again be formidable. Coleman averaged more than 11 touches per game last season, and that level of involvement should lead to production in Week 1 against the Bears. Although Chicago was tough last year on running backs from a fantasy perspective, the high blowout potential could lead to a lot of garbage time for Coleman in this one, making him a decent fantasy option."
25,Theo Riddick,DET,ARI,17,45,27.2,4.9,"The return of Ameer Abdullah may worry Riddick owners, but Riddick was never meant to be a bell-cow back anyway. His pass-catching abilities always make him a valuable asset in PPR leagues, even when splitting carries. But his owners couldn't possibly ask for a worse matchup in Week 1. Not only are the Cardinals the best team in the league against opposing running backs, they allowed a meager 385 yards receiving and just two receiving touchdowns against running backs last year. Riddick will always be someone who you can play in a pinch, especially in PPR leagues. But this should likely be one of his least productive games of the season."
26,Terrance West,BAL,CIN,16,38,27.9,5.2,"The 32-year-old Danny Woodhead is still dealing with a hamstring injury. While he is expected to play, West should see the bulk of the work. Now that he is in a Greg Roman scheme, West's abilities should be better utilized and he could break out beginning here in Week 1."
27,Joe Mixon,CIN,BAL,11,48,28.7,6.5,"Until we see Mixon in a prominent role in the offense, it's best to take the wait-and-see approach. It's a bit easier to do that in Week 1 considering the Ravens are among the best in the game when it comes to slowing down their opponents run-game. They allowed just eight rushing touchdowns last year and Mixon isn't going to be handed goal-line duties from the get-go. The only way he provides a startable performance this week is if he breaks a long run/catch. "
28,Duke Johnson,CLE,PIT,21,41,29.4,4.8
29,Frank Gore,IND,LAR,18,42,30.1,5.6,"Say what you want about his ability or tape, but Frank Gore has been a top 12 fantasy running back each of the past two seasons. The Rams have some impressive players on the defensive side of the ball, but Aaron Donald is holding out and LA has stuggled against the run in the past two decades so Gore is a start this week."
30,Adrian Peterson,NO,MIN,18,44,31.0,6.2,"There are few better narratives in Week 1 than Peterson facing off against the Vikings in Minnesota. Given his comments, Peterson will undoubtedly be motivated to be at his best, and it's likely that the Saints will try to get him some goal-line work in an effort to get a touchdown. While it remains to be seen how much Peterson has left in the tank or the exact breakdown of the workload in the New Orleans backfield, the narrative alone, and the likelihood that Peterson scores a touchdown, makes him a fine play in the first game of the season."
31,James White,NE,KC,16,41,30.1,5.2
32,Darren Sproles,PHI,WAS,17,49,32.3,6.1,"Entering his final year in the NFL, Sproles is the one running back on the Eagles who has a fairly defined role. Sproles has tallied at least 52 receptions in each of the past two years, and should do so again here. Although the Redskins struggle against the run, they allowed the third-fewest PPR points to running backs last season, making Sproles less of an intriguing play than he usually is. Still, he's a guarantee to get a handful of touches, which always leaves him as a potential flex play."
33,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,SF,21,47,32.9,5.0,"While Christian McCaffrey deservedly got a ton of fantasy buzz this preseason, Stewart remains relevant, and will continue to play the role of the standard running back. The 49ers were the worst team against running backs in 2016, and haven't made enough changes to improve significantly. The Panthers will likely be playing from ahead, which should allow them to lean on Stewart and the running game in this one, and it's a good bet that this will be one of Stewart's best games of the season."
34,Robert Kelley,WAS,PHI,18,58,33.2,7.7,"While everyone assumed Samaje Perine would take over the starting role, his rough preseason thrust Kelley back into the starter's role. Kelley found success last year after taking over the starter's role in Week 8, scoring the 14th-most fantasy points among running backs in that span. The Eagles were solid against the run last season, but the loss of Bennie Logan from the defensive line should give Kelley some running room. At the very least, he should get some goal-line work, making him a potential RB2. "
35,Mike Gillislee,NE,KC,9,48,32.4,6.4
36,Paul Perkins,NYG,DAL,25,46,35.1,5.2,"The hate likely went a little too far for Perkins this preseason, as he was the 31st running back selected in ADP, despite being a starting running back in what should be a solid offense. Perkins should get the vast majority of the workload this season, including in Week 1 against the Cowboys. Dallas was solid against running backs last season, allowing the fourth-fewest fantasy points to the position, though Giants' running backs combined for 55 carries and 208 yards rushing against them in 2016. It's far from an ideal matchup, but Perkins' volume alone should make him a startable RB3 in this one with upside for a bit more."
37,Matt Forte,NYJ,BUF,24,49,37.5,6.1
38,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,WAS,21,56,38.6,7.3,"Blount signed with the Eagles after a shocking 2016 campaign with the Patriots, that saw him run for 1,161 yards and 18 touchdowns. But any excitement about his prospects vanished with his dismal preseason performance, and word from the coaching staff that they envision a timeshare. Although the Redskins struggle to stop the run (20 total touchdowns and 1724 rushing yards allowed), it would be unwise to start Blount in Week 1 without knowing the exact breakdown of the Eagles' backfield."
39,Chris Thompson,WAS,PHI,30,57,38.7,5.7,"Thompson was a fine asset in PPR leagues last season, totaling 705 combined rushing and receiving yards with 49 receptions and five total touchdowns. Samaje Perine largely flopped in the preseason, and Rob Kelley is not a reliable pass-catcher. That should once again leave Thompson in the position of being the third-down back. The Eagles were solid against the rush last season, but they allowed 596 receiving yards to the position. Thompson will contribute in Week 1, as he usually does, but is doubtful to make a significant impact."
40,C.J. Prosise,SEA,GB,22,59,41.2,6.6,"With Pete Carroll's recent declaration that Prosise is ""100 percent, ready to go,"" the young back enters the discussion for a desperation PPR play. Eddie Lacy struggled this preseason and Thomas Rawls is dealing with a high-ankle sprain, which could lead to a big role for Prosise in a likely shootout. The Packers were generally stingy against pass-catching backs in 2016, allowing only one receiving touchdown to the position. But if Prosise gets a big workload, he should be able to find success. Unfortunately, without a clear breakdown of how the snaps will play out in the Seattle backfield in Week 1, Prosise is just a desperation play in PPR leagues."
41,Derrick Henry,TEN,OAK,25,51,41.6,4.9
42,Shane Vereen,NYG,DAL,31,55,41.4,6.0,"The Giants are committed to Paul Perkins as their lead back at this point, but they've also made it clear that Vereen will have a chunk of the touches in this offense. He has proven to be one of the most consistent third down backs in football, so while his upside is hindered by the expected touches, he possesses enough of a floor that he may be worth owning for depth."
43,Eddie Lacy,SEA,GB,28,56,41.9,6.6,"There are plenty of intriguing storylines in Lacy's first game with the Seahawks, including a homecoming against his former team, the Packers, as well as an unclear running back situation in Seattle. Lacy was signed to a one-year incentive-laden deal this offseason, presumably to be the primary ball carrier. But a sluggish preseason and talk of a committee took the bloom off the rose for the running back. The Packers' rush defense completely fell apart last season, allowing 4.7 yards per carry over the final 12 games, and you know the Seahawks would love to get Lacy a touchdown against his former team. But behind one of the worst offensive lines in football and without a clear indication of his workload, Lacy makes an RB3, at best, in Week 1."
44,Jamaal Charles,DEN,LAC,34,62,43.6,5.5,"He made the roster after a tremendous Week 3 performance in the pre-season where he looked sharp in his cuts and strong in run blocking. We aren't sure what his workload will be at this point but we are talking about the all-time NFL leader in yards per carry, so if he gets his hands on the ball, he could cut into CJ Anderson's carries quite a bit and perhaps take over the job if he stumbles. There is of course injury risk, but you don't often find this type of potential sitting on the waiver wire."
45,Giovani Bernard,CIN,BAL,35,63,43.8,5.1,"Gio has looks electric again this preseason, but there just isn't enough work to go around with Mixon, Hill, Eifert and A.J. Green getting their share. In a PPR league, Gio is a fringe flex play most weeks, but this is a tougher matchup so he isn't even startable there."
46,Rex Burkhead,NE,KC,21,68,44.7,9.1,"For now, Gillislee is expected to receive the lion's share of the work in what is perhaps the best offense in football, but with Belichek running the show, we should regard it as more of a mystery than your typical depth chart. If Burkhead were to receive the surprise bulk of the carries, he would be in a scheme that saw a mediocre LeGarrette Blount finish as the #7 RB in football because of all the goal-line work."
47,Jeremy Hill,CIN,BAL,27,57,45.8,6.3,"It seems clear at this point that Joe Mixon will run away with this job, but Hill is technically still the starter, so if you need a one week solution, look no further. He should receive the brunt of the goal-line work at first and see enough carries to be relied upon in a pinch for flex play."
48,Thomas Rawls,SEA,GB,29,99,49.5,10.2,"Rawls is questionable coming into Week 1 against the Packers, as he continues to recover from an ankle sprain. Even if he does play, it's anyone's guess as to how the workload will be split between Rawls and Eddie Lacy this season. For Week 1, Lacy makes the more intriguing play, as the ""return to Green Bay"" narrative will likely lead Pete Carroll to give Lacy every opportunity at the goal-line. Rawls' injury, combined with the uncertain workload, makes him an unappealing start in Week 1, despite the matchup against a Green Bay defense that allowed 4.7 yards per carry over its final 12 games last year."
49,Darren McFadden,DAL,NYG,21,70,50.6,10.2,"Drafted as a fill-in running back for the first few games of the season, McFadden will be relegated to a bench role in Week 1, after Ezekiel Elliott was declared active for Week 1. Obviously, hold McFadden if you own him, as Elliott is still facing a six-game suspension that could start in Week 2. For this game, however, there's no way fantasy owners can possibly start McFadden with Elliott active. Not only is it an incredibly tough matchup (the Giants allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs in 2016), but with McFadden potentially carrying a huge workload beginning next week, the Cowboys aren't going to want to risk him getting hurt here. Absent being completely decimated at running back, avoid McFadden at all costs this week."
50,Alvin Kamara,NO,MIN,36,64,50.1,6.3
51,Latavius Murray,MIN,NO,39,65,50.3,4.7,"Murray's stock dropped quickly after the Vikings drafted Dalvin Cook, as he'll likely be relegated to goal-line work. While that hurts his fantasy outlook overall, it's not an awful thing in his Week 1 matchup against the Saints. New Orleans allowed the third-most fantasy points to opposing running backs last season, including 18 rushing touchdowns. That means that this is likely one of Murray's best chances to have opportunities at scoring one or more touchdowns. If you're absolutely desperate at running back, you could do worse to start your season."
52,Kyle Juszczyk,SF,CAR,29,75,56.4,11.0
53,Charcandrick West,KC,NE,37,73,55.3,8.1
54,Wendell Smallwood,PHI,WAS,41,69,54.9,7.3
55,Dion Lewis,NE,KC,40,62,52.7,5.7,"Lewis is good for a handful of strong fantasy outings per year if he stays healthy, but it is anyone's guess which games those will be. This is expected to be a shootout so perhaps he ends up in the end zone, but it isn't likely enough that you should bank on it by starting him."
56,Chris Carson,SEA,GB,41,85,60.1,12.3,"Carson is technically 4th in the Seahawks crowded backfield behind Eddie Lacy, Thomas Rawls and C.J. Prosise, but this rookie has a tremendous athletic profile and apparently Pete Carroll's heart as well. All pre-season, he has appeared to be the best running back in this backfield, and know the way Carroll functions, he will get the best man on the field. Look for him to get a handful of touches in week 1, and if he ends up the hot hand, he may just take over and never look back."
57,Tarik Cohen,CHI,ATL,38,74,55.4,8.4
58,D'Onta Foreman,HOU,JAC,41,73,59.2,8.5,"Lamar Miller was among the least efficient runners in the NFL last season, so as makes sense, the Texans sought to draft another back with a workhorse build. If Miller were to go down, Foreman would immediately become the bell-cow, alebit for a bad offense. Even so, he will get a share of the carries and could significantly cut into Miller's carries if he proves to be more efficient."
59,DeAndre Washington,OAK,TEN,41,62,53.3,4.6,"Marshawn Lynch is old, overweight and has been proven to be injury prone. The notion that he will get over 200 carries this season is almost laughable. That gives Washington, who is waiting in the wings, a nice safe floor, but he also comes with considerable upside. If Lynch were to sustain another injury, Washington would get the brunt of the work behind a phenomenal offensve line."
60,Jamaal Williams,GB,SEA,44,69,56.2,6.6,"It seems for now that Ty Montgomery is actually the three down back for Green Bay, but Jamaal Williams has looked good and there is a chance Montgomery doesn't get a full game's work and that Williams shines enough to take over the lead duties. Remember, Montgomery was only trusted with double-digit carries just once last season."
61,Robert Turbin,IND,LAR,46,67,55.2,4.9,"Turbin is going to be utilized quite a bit more than the general public seems to realize. That isn't to say he will be fantasy relevant with Andrew Luck out, but he is a piece worth keeping an eye on for a waiver wire pickup, especially in PPR leagues."
62,Marlon Mack,IND,LAR,41,78,62.9,7.3
63,T.J. Yeldon,JAC,HOU,46,75,59.6,7.5
64,Samaje Perine,WAS,PHI,41,73,61.7,6.1,"Rob Kelley may have the job in Washington for now, but Perine is the superior athlete, pass catcher and run blocker so it seems like only a matter of time before they hand Perine the keys to this high-scoring offense. Should he take over in the first few weeks, he has the ability and scheme to finish as a top 20 running back. That kind of upside is rare to find on the waiver wire right after drafts."
65,Jalen Richard,OAK,TEN,46,71,59.9,6.0
66,James Conner,PIT,CLE,45,78,66.5,7.4,"With Fitzgerald Toussaint being cut, the Steelers made it clear that James Conner is now the direct backup to the ever injury-prone, Le'Veon Bell. Should he go down for an extended period of time once again, Conner could admirably fill the role that DeAngelo Williams had when he was among the top backs in football. Conner is worth owning based soley on that volume upside."
