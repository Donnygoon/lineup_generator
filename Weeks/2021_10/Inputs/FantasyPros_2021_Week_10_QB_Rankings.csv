Dobbins and Gus Edwards have Jackson poised to produce huge fantasy numbers this season. In Week 10, Jackson put up 32.6 fantasy points in a 34-31 win over the Vikings, thanks in large part to his season-high 120 rushing yards on 21 carries. It also didn't hurt that the Ravens ran 89 offensive plays in a game that was settled in overtime, giving Jackson ample scoring opportunities. The perfect-storm scenario remains very much in place for Jackson's Thursday-night matchup against the Dolphins, who are giving up 22.2 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, the third-highest total in the league. Two weeks ago, Miami allowed another highly mobile quarterback, Buffalo's Josh Allen, to run eight times for 55 yards and a touchdown. Jackson is the QB1 in this week's rankings. At $20,700 in DraftKings' Thursday-night showdown, Jackson will eat up 41.4% of your five-player budget, but you're more or less surrendering if you don't pay up for him.",,,QB1,A+,26.7,0.42250000000000004

It's only a matter of time before the 49ers turn back to their first-round draft pick, Trey Lance, which makes Garoppolo a high-risk, low-reward fantasy option every week.

Most of his production came in the last 11 minutes of regulation after the Saints had fallen into a 24-6 hole. Siemian deserves credit for his part in the Saints' late rally, but anyone who watched that game knows that Siemian is at risk of being replaced by Taysom Hill. Obviously, Siemian is only playing because Jameis Winston is out for the year with a torn ACL, and he simply isn't playable in fantasy except perhaps in superflex leagues.",,,QB22,F,15.3,0.16562000000000002

He's been decent so far, although Tua has been somewhat matchup-sensitive. In the four games he's started and finished, he played well against the Jaguars and Falcons, not so well against the Patriots and Bills. Poor offensive line play has been a problem for Miami all year - PFF ranks the Dolphins last in the league in pass blocking - and the Dolphins will be without WRs DeVante Parker (hamstring) and Will Fuller (finger). It's a tough spot for whichever quarterback starts for the Dolphins. Tua is tentatively ranked QB21 this week. Brissett was ineffective in Miami's unsightly 17-9 win over Houston in Week 9, completing 26 of 43 passes for 244 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.
