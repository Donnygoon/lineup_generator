The team needed a vertical receiver now that Henry Ruggs is facing a felony DUI charge and other charges after a car crash that killed a young woman and her dog. Jackson has always been a boom-or-bust receiver, and there's probably going to be a lot more bust than boom for a 34-year-old receiver who's joining a new team midseason.
