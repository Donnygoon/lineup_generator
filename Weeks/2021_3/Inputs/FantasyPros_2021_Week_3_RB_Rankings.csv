The Cardinals were heavy favorites and they eventually pulled away in the second half to a big victory over the Jaguars. With this game-script, Conner was utilized heavily around the goal-line and he ended up cashing in for multiple touchdowns on the ground. While he was a solid option for fantasy managers that played him in a pinch last week, we shouldn't be expecting this type of production from him every week moving forward. He's only worth considering for your starting lineup in matchups where the Cardinals are projected to be up by a significant amount where they'll turn to their run game. Even in that instance though, he could still easily lose goal-line touches to Murray and disappoint managers that took the chance on him. In week four against the Rams defense, Conner's a low-end RB3 at best.",,,RB44,D,6.7,0.15391025641025644
