Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Rob Gronkowski,NE,NYJ,1,6,1.7,1.1,"As long as Gronk plays, he must be plugged back into your lineups. Granted, there is always a chance he ends up a late scratch for some reason, so keep an eye on the situation, but at this point, he is well worth the risk."
2,Zach Ertz,PHI,CAR,1,11,1.9,1.6,"Ertz has seen an incredible 48 targets this season, as is on pace for 102 catches and 1,238 yards. He'll have a tough matchup on Thursday, as the Panthers allow the sixth-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends. But Ertz has been utterly matchup-proof this season, and he can never be considered anything other than a top-three tight end. Start him with confidence, as always. "
3,Travis Kelce,KC,PIT,1,5,3.0,0.6
4,Delanie Walker,TEN,IND,1,12,5.0,1.8,"Delanie Walker has a long touchdown last weekâ€¦ that was called back due to a holding penalty that had no bearing on the result of the play, so his stat line of just 3/25/0 could have ended much differently. He's still yet to score a receiving touchdown this year, but the Colts are a team who really struggles to defend tight ends. In the two games against them last year, Walker combined for 11 receptions, 120 yards, and a touchdown. The Colts have allowed a tight end touchdown in three consecutive weeks, so get Walker in lineups as a TE1 even if Cassel is starting.  "
5,Jordan Reed,WAS,SF,3,16,6.1,2.7,"Reed is off the injury report this week, so he should be back to full strength against the 49ers. San Francisco is surprisingly one of the toughest defenses against opposing tight ends, allowing the fewest fantasy points to the position. But they haven't had to face many top talents, so their ranking is not enough of a worry to downgrade Reed significantly.The Redskins have a huge implied total, and if they do score a lot of points, it's likely that Reed will get a piece of it. Consider him a solid TE1, as he always should be when healthy."
6,Austin Seferian-Jenkins,NYJ,NE,3,12,6.3,1.9,"If you lost Charles Clay or own Gronk and are worried about what we might not know regarding his injury, ASJ ought to be a top priority. He is almost certainly the best tight end available in your league. He has had plenty of hype and let down fantasy owners for years, but the ability is real, and finally we are getting to see him with consistent targets."
7,Evan Engram,NYG,DEN,2,13,7.2,2.4,"If there is one player to consider on the Giants roster, it's Evan Engram, as he's going to see a ton of targets going forward. He has already seen 34 targets, which ranks No. 4 among tight ends, behind only Zach Ertz, Jason Witten, and Travis Kelce. The Broncos have struggled at defending tight ends to this point, too, allowing 24/245/2 on just 33 targets to them. The lack of playmakers around him is definitely concerning, but not enough to take him out of the TE1 conversation."
8,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,GB,5,17,8.8,2.3,"Rudolph finally saw an uptick in targets and scored his first touchdown of the season last week. While that should hopefully portend good things for Rudolph going forward, it's not an ideal matchup for him this week against Green Bay. The Packers allow the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends, and not a single opposing tight end has finished in the top-12 at the position. Consider Rudolph a borderline TE1, and hope he continues to see significant targets."
9,Hunter Henry,LAC,OAK,5,15,9.2,2.6,"Now that Hunter Henry is playing 75% of the Chargers' offensive snaps, he ought to be regarded as a must start each week, especially in a matchup against the Raiders, who have struggled to defend tight ends for years now."
10,Cameron Brate,TB,ARI,2,22,9.9,3.7,"Brate has now caught a touchdown in three consecutive games, as he's proven himself to be an integral part of the Tampa Bay offense. The Cardinals are middle of the road against opposing tight ends, so it's not a matchup that should scare you off Brate. Consider him a mid-TE1, and keep rolling him out there until the red zone targets stop."
11,Martellus Bennett,GB,MIN,6,19,10.5,2.0,"Bennett saw his fewest targets of the season (3) but had his highest yardage total (53) on Sunday against the Cowboys. If the Vikings defense has a weakness, it's defending the tight end, as they allow the ninth-most fantasy points to the position. Bennett's target volume eventually has to lead to a huge day, and given the state of the position, he's still a TE1 here, as he will be most weeks."
12,Ryan Griffin,HOU,CLE,6,23,13.3,3.4,"Griffin is not much of a receiving weapon, but Cleveland has really struggled against tight ends over their past 20+ games, so you can feel good about plugging him into your starting lineup if you are in a tough spot this week."
13,Jared Cook,OAK,LAC,6,26,14.3,3.7,"Jared Cook has been getting the targets (31 on the year), but his production doesn't match that. He's failed to top 56 yards on the season and has only caught one touchdown, which came against the Redskins, who are literally one of the three worst teams at defending tight ends. The Chargers have been stellar at defending opposing tight ends, allowing only Zach Ertz to total more than six PPR points, and they have played against Travis Kelce and Evan Engram. Keep Cook out of fantasy lineups this week.  "
14,George Kittle,SF,WAS,9,29,14.8,3.6,"Kittle was excellent against the Colts on Sunday, catching nine passes for 83 yards and a touchdown. But he had just eight targets in his previous three games, and the 49ers offense had been stagnant for some time. He's likely earned himself a higher target share going forward, and that's a good thing against Washington next week, which struggles defending tight ends. But in terms of long-term value, there are plenty of better options on the waiver wire."
15,Benjamin Watson,BAL,CHI,11,22,15.7,2.8
16,Zach Miller,CHI,BAL,10,25,16.9,3.3,"Miller received seven targets on Monday night against the Vikings, and now ranks second in targets (27) and receiving yards (182) for the Bears. Mitchell Trubisky targeted Miller and Dion Sims 11 times out of his 25 pass attempts, so there's every reason to expect Miller to continue to see a high volume of targets going forward. The Ravens allow the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends and have allowed four touchdowns to the position, most in the NFL. That makes Miller a potential streamer this week, though one that likely falls just outside of the TE1 range."
17,Coby Fleener,NO,DET,13,24,17.2,2.8,"Fleener has cooled off considerably after a hot start, with just three catches for 42 yards in his last two games. He'll now take on a Lions team that has been tough on opposing tight ends, but that's largely due to their ability to limit touchdowns. Detroit actually has allowed the fourth-most yardage to the position on the season, including 12.2 yards per target, most in the NFL. With Willie Snead back, Fleener is unlikely to see more than a handful of targets, but he makes a borderline TE1 here based on the matchup."
18,Austin Hooper,ATL,MIA,4,25,17.8,3.8,"Hooper finally saw some targets in Week 4 against the Bills, though that was largely the product of Julio Jones' and Mohamed Sanu's injuries. The Dolphins allow the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, and with Sanu set to miss this week's game with a hamstring strain, Hooper could again be in line for significant targets. Consider him a borderline TE1 with upside."
19,Ed Dickson,CAR,PHI,11,30,18.0,3.4,"Dickson exploded against the Lions with five catches for 175 yards, and although it was obviously fluky, he did have three catches for 62 yards against the Patriots the week before. Dickson has had his chances at fantasy relevance before and failed to make anything of them, but it's hard not to be intrigued by his usage in the Carolina offense. If you're desperate tight end, he's a decent add."
20,A.J. Derby,DEN,NYG,5,27,19.3,5.0,"The Broncos have not really given one tight end the primary role, as both A.J. Derby and Virgil Green are both playing a decent amount of snaps. Derby is the better talent and has seen more targets, but Green has played 54 more snaps than him. It's disappointing because the Giants are brutal against tight ends and have allowed six different tight ends to finish as top-12 options. They've only played five games. If you're betting on one, it should be Derby.  "
21,Jack Doyle,IND,TEN,9,25,19.1,3.6
22,David Njoku,CLE,HOU,15,27,21.8,2.9,"The Browns haven't used Njoku much, as is often the case with rookie tight ends, but when the ball has been thrown his way, he has shown some serious ability. There is a possibility he breaks out with the likely QB change and is worth a speculative add, plus they have been using him in the red zone, so he is a quality streamer any given week."
23,Eric Ebron,DET,NO,15,27,22.1,2.9,"Ebron has had a disastrous season thus far, with just 12 catches for 93 yards and a touchdown, with several drops along the way. He's tied for 28th among tight ends in fantasy points and is playing only about 50 percent of the snaps now, losing time to Daniel Fells. The Saints may have a leaky defense, but they're not terrible against tight ends, allowing just 13 catches to the position through four games. Ebron simply can't be started in fantasy leagues right now."
