Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Denver Broncos,DEN,NYG,1,4,1.1,0.5,"You won't find a better matchup for a defense this week, as the Broncos will be taking on what essentially looks like a practice squad of the Giants, as they have lost their top three wide receivers for this game. Their offensive line has been the talk of the league due to their poor performance, and the Broncos pass-rush is going to overwhelm them. "
2,Atlanta Falcons,ATL,MIA,1,8,3.6,1.5,"Coming off their bye week, the Falcons will be at home against a Dolphins offense that's failed to score 20 points in any one game this year. Keep in mind that they've played against the Chargers, Jets, and Titans defenses. Jay Cutler is prone to turnovers when under pressure and the Falcons should work past his offensive line with ease. "
3,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,LAR,1,13,3.6,1.9,"The Jaguars have a pass-rush unlike many NFL teams and one that's now averaged a sack on 10.2 percent of opposing quarterback dropbacks, which is rather ridiculous. Jared Goff has been able to sit back and take his time for the most part, but the Jaguars are going to pressure him into some questionable decisions, while taking away Sammy Watkins with their top two cornerbacks. Todd Gurley can have a solid game and your defense can still turn a profit. "
4,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,CHI,1,12,3.9,1.8
5,Houston Texans,HOU,CLE,1,12,4.5,1.9
6,Washington Redskins,WAS,SF,2,18,6.4,2.4,"The Redskins have seven turnovers and 12 sacks on the season, as they've been surprisingly effective despite some fairly difficult matchups. They'll now take on a 49ers team that somehow allows only the 17th-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs. But San Francisco is coming off back-to-back overtime games and is playing in its third straight road game. They'll likely be sloppy on both sides of the ball, leaving plenty of opportunities for the Redskins D/ST to make plays."
7,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,PIT,3,16,8.1,2.1
8,New England Patriots,NE,NYJ,4,19,8.1,2.7
9,Los Angeles Rams,LAR,JAC,3,20,8.8,2.7
10,Carolina Panthers,CAR,PHI,5,18,11.2,2.1,"The Panthers get to the opposing quarterback as well as anyone, with 17 sacks through their first five games. But they've totaled only three turnovers this season, and haven't made many big plays. Sacks should come this week again for the Panthers D/ST, as the Eagles allow plenty of quarterback hits and will be playing without Lane Johnson. But the Eagles also allow the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing D/STs, and given that the Panthers haven't been able to force many turnovers, the D/ST is only a borderline start here."
11,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,TB,4,24,11.3,2.8,"Arizona has done very little on the defensive side of the ball so far this season, generating just four turnovers and 10 sacks on the season. They'll now take on a Bucs team that allows the fifth-fewest fantasy points to opposing D/STs. The Cardinals are at home, but that's about the only positive for them in this game. Fantasy owners should not expect a huge effort. "
12,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,CAR,7,23,12.4,2.1,"The Eagles D/ST hasn't been an elite unit this season, but they've certainly provided a solid floor for fantasy owners. On the season, they've amassed 14 sacks, eight turnovers, and one touchdown. The Panthers are middle of the road in terms of points allowed to opposing D/STs, but they've been particularly stingy in the last two weeks now that Cam Newton has found his form. In a short week and in Carolina, the Eagles D/ST isn't a great play."
13,Tennessee Titans,TEN,IND,7,21,12.8,2.4
14,Green Bay Packers,GB,MIN,2,25,13.6,3.2,"The Packers D/ST has been rolling lately, with seven turnovers in their last two games. They'll now take on a Vikings defense that has been stingy against opposing D/STs, allowing the seventh fewest fantasy points to the position. But with Stefon Diggs and Dalvin Cook, Minnesota may have trouble moving the ball well, and there could be opportunities for the Packers to make plays. Still, they are just a borderline starting option here."
15,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,TB,ARI,6,25,14.7,3.4,"The Bucs haven't done all that much on defense thus far, generating just four sacks and six turnovers. The Cardinals have been generous to opposing D/STs, allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to the position. Tampa Bay is starting to get healthier on defense, but they're far from full strength. Consider them only a borderline startable option."
