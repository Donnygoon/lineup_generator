Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,KC,1,6,1.7,1.0,"Bell didn't quite dominate to the clip we were all hoping for, but the game script wasn't in his favor after Big Ben's two pick sixs. Kansas City isn't exactly the best opportunity to ""bounce back"" but he is so talented that Bell is still the #1 RB this week."
2,Kareem Hunt,KC,PIT,1,6,1.8,0.9,"What Hunt has been doing is absolutley phenomenal. There is a real chance he puts up another 100+ this week, as Pittsburgh's run defense has proven prone to giving up some big running back perfromances."
3,Todd Gurley,LAR,JAC,1,9,3.6,1.2,"Gurley finally hit a speedbump last week against the Seahawks last week, gaining just 43 yards on 14 carries. He should have a chance to rebound against the Jaguars this week, as Jacksonville allows eighth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. The Jaguars' pass defense is absolutely elite, so expect the Rams to give them a heavy dose of Gurley and look to establish the run game throughout. Gurley is a stud RB1 in this one."
4,Leonard Fournette,JAC,LAR,1,8,3.6,1.1,"While the Rams have some serious talent on their defense, they can't tackle top save their lives so this looks like another 20+ touches for one of the best rookie running backs we have seen in the past decade. He is a top 3 RB this week once again."
5,Melvin Gordon,LAC,OAK,1,11,5.3,1.5,"Gordon had his biggest workload of the season last week and performed admirably for fantasy owners with 2 touchdowns and over 100 yards. While this week's game script doesn't exactly set up well, he has a solid matchup and should be considered an RB1."
6,Devonta Freeman,ATL,MIA,2,9,5.7,1.2,"Freeman has again been one of the top backs in football, but he'll have a tough matchup in Week 6 against the Dolphins. Miami allows just 3.4 yards per carry, though they are somewhat vulnerable to pass-catching backs. But the Falcons are huge favorites here, and should be playing with a lead for most of the game. That should mean plenty of rushing opportunities for both Freeman and Tevin Coleman, which should be more than enough to succeed despite the tough matchup."
7,C.J. Anderson,DEN,NYG,5,15,7.9,2.1,"C.J. Anderson should be ready for a big workload against the Giants, who have allowed opponents at least 99 rushing yards in every contest this year, including 171 to the Eagles back in Week 3. They're allowing 4.47 yards per carry on the season and seem to be getting worse as the team continues to lose. Outside of the one game against the Bills, Anderson has totaled at least 20 carries in every game, making him a must-play in this matchup. I'd be surprised if he didn't finish as a low-end RB1."
8,Lamar Miller,HOU,CLE,5,22,10.3,3.2,"The Browns' run defense hasn't been as bad against the run as you might expect, considering the trainwreck they've been the last two seasons. Still, the game script and Miller's expected workload make him an RB1 this weekend."
9,Jordan Howard,CHI,BAL,7,25,11.2,3.3,"Howard continues to gut it out through obvious discomfort in his shoulder, as he frequently leaves games for treatment before coming right back in. He's averaged 20 carries per game through each of his last three games, and has significantly out-paced Tarik Cohen in recent weeks. The Ravens are decent against opposing running backs, but Howard's volume alone makes him a solid RB2 play here, even with rookie Mitchell Trubisky at the helm."
10,Mark Ingram,NO,DET,6,27,11.5,4.3,"Adrian Peterson is finally off the Saints' roster, which should be a boost to both Ingram and Alvin Kamara. Ingram has seen his touches increase every game so far this season, and that trend should continue this weekend against the Lions. Detroit is generally solid against opposing running backs, but they have allowed four touchdowns to the position. At home and off a bye, expect the Saints offense to come out firing, and for Ingram to make a borderline RB1."
11,DeMarco Murray,TEN,IND,3,22,12.7,4.1,"This is a plus matchup for Murray and the Titans' offense, but Murray's upside is limited because the Titans haven't trusted him with 15 or more carries even once this season. Granted, he is still a start, but don't expect too much."
12,Doug Martin,TB,ARI,7,43,14.3,4.9,"Martin was on the field for just 25 out of the Bucs' 68 offensive snaps on Thursday against the Patriots, but scored a touchdown and averaged 5.7 yards per carry. He should see his snap count increase significantly this weekend against the Cardinals. It's a tough matchup, as Arizona allows the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs. But Martin looked dynamic last week, and will get the goal-line looks. He falls outside the RB1 territory here, but makes a rock-solid RB2."
13,Jay Ajayi,MIA,ATL,5,37,14.7,4.8,"We haven't seen Ajayi get in the end zone this season, but he is getting plenty of work and hasn't looked bad by any means. The touchdowns will come, and although the game script isn't ideal, he is a low-end RB1 this week."
14,Duke Johnson,CLE,HOU,7,25,15.7,4.9,"The Texans have allowed two running backs to hit the 100-yard mark against them, but let's not pretend that Duke Johnson is going to get close to that with his 4-6 carries he gets per week. That number is likely to rise, but he's still just an upside-RB3 until Jackson lets him overtake Crowell in the touch department. It's also worth noting that no running back has caught more than three passes against the Texans this year, though they've allowed three receiving touchdowns to them.  "
15,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,PHI,7,26,15.9,4.2,"McCaffrey has really struggled to get things going in the running game, averaging just 2.8 yards per carry on the season. But his heavy involvement in the passing game (at least five targets and four catches in every game this season) provides him a fairly high weekly floor. The Eagles are tough against opposing running backs, allowing the seventh-fewest fantasy points to the position. But on a short week where the defense will likely be tired, McCaffrey is in play as a Flex."
16,Jerick McKinnon,MIN,GB,8,38,16.5,6.0,"Everyone was expecting Murray to take over this job, and he did get the start, but it was McKinnon who shined. In years past, it has been mentioned that he has RB1 upside, but he never made the most of limited opportunities. He may just have taken over the job, and if it proves to be the case, he has substantial upside."
17,Alvin Kamara,NO,DET,7,32,17.3,5.1,"Kamara is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of the Adrian Peterson trade, as his share of touches should only continue to increase, particularly after Week 4's breakout game. The Lions are generally tough against opposing running backs, but they've allowed 32 catches and 291 yards receiving to the position, and that is where Kamara shines. He should see close to 15 touches in the game, and make a decent RB2 with upside for more."
18,Javorius Allen,BAL,CHI,8,33,17.3,6.1,"Alex Collins is breathing down his neck and Terrance West is still looming after his return, but for this week, Collins is in the dog house with fumble issues and West is dealing with his injury. Allen should get 15+ touches again against a defense with injuries galore."
19,Carlos Hyde,SF,WAS,9,30,18.6,5.1,"Hyde owners understood that the running back was an injury risk, but few expected him to lose carries to Matt Breida because he wasn't the ""hot hand."" Breida out-snapped Hyde 35 to 33 on Sunday against the Colts, and the breakdown of the 49ers backfield is unclear going forward. The Redskins are decent against opposing running backs, and have allowed just one rushing touchdown this season. Further concerning for Hyde is the likely game script, as a rested Redskins team will surely be able to put up points at will against an exhausted 49ers defense. Given Hyde's hip injury, he may not see all that many snaps in this game after the first half. It's hard to keep him out of the RB2 discussion even with all those factors given his talent, but expectations must be tempered."
20,Ameer Abdullah,DET,NO,10,28,19.2,4.3,"Abdullah has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry this season, but he's been a solid fantasy contributor by virtue of his consistent touches. He'll now have an opportunity for a big game against a Saints defense that allows the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. The Saints struggle more against pass-catching backs, so it's possible that Theo Riddick will be more involved than usual. But Abdullah should still see plenty of work, and make a solid RB2 on Sunday."
21,James White,NE,NYJ,9,29,21.1,4.3,"White is hit or miss, and while sometimes he can be a headache, his ceiling is too much to ignore. He has 17 receptions in the past two weeks with all of the Pats' wide receiver injuries, so make sure to plug him in for your flex."
22,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,LAC,7,32,21.2,4.7,"The Raiders are going to be home favorites against a Chargers team that has allowed over 161 rushing yards per game, by far the most in the NFL. In fact, they have allowed 74 more yards than the next closest team. Keep in mind that they've played against Jay Ajayi (totaled 122 yards against them, has 139 yards in his other three games combined), LeGarrette Blount (136 yards), and the Giants ""run game"" last week (144 yards). Lynch is a safe bet for a touchdown and should get a good chunk of yardage as well. "
23,Andre Ellington,ARI,TB,11,34,21.7,3.9,"Ellington caught nine passes on Sunday against the Eagles, making it his second consecutive game with that number of receptions. While he's doing little in the running game, he now has totaled at least 59 receiving yards in three straight games, and has been a borderline RB1 over that span. Although newly-acquired Adrian Peterson figures to see the bulk of the carries going forward, that shouldn't impact Ellington much, as his 20 percent target share should remain constant. The Bucs are middle of the road against running backs, but they've allowed 29 receptions to the position in just four games. Ellington should be able to do his usual damage through the air, and be a solid Flex option this week."
24,Aaron Jones,GB,MIN,10,44,22.4,6.6,"Jones shined on Sunday against the Cowboys, playing nearly all of the snaps and gaining 134 yards with a touchdown on 20 touches. He's surely earned himself a bigger role going forward, even when Ty Montgomery returns, which could be as soon as this week. The Vikings are incredibly tough on opposing running backs, allowing the second-fewest fantasy points to the position and allowing just 3.3 yards per carry. But the Packers are obviously a dynamic offense, and Jones can be considered a Flex play even if Montgomery returns, as expected."
25,Chris Thompson,WAS,SF,9,69,25.2,7.9,"There are a litany of factors that weigh strongly in favor of Thompson in this week's matchup against the 49ers. The Redskins are rested and off a bye, while San Francisco is coming off two straight road overtime games. The 49ers allow the third-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, and particularly struggle against pass-catching backs, having allowed the most receptions (35) and third-most receiving yardage (300) to the position. Further, Rob Kelley is likely out this week. Add all that into the mix and Thompson should be considered a solid RB2 this week."
26,Tevin Coleman,ATL,MIA,13,33,25.0,3.3,"Coleman had his best game of the season in Week 4 against the Bills, totaling 13 touches for 142 yards, and he seems to be the primary pass-catching back for Atlanta, with 13 catches on the season already. That's a boon in this matchup against Miami, as the Dolphins have allowed four running backs to total at least four receptions thus far this season. Off a bye, the Falcons should be able to handle the Dolphins easily, and that should mean plenty of opportunities for both Coleman and Devonta Freeman."
27,Mike Gillislee,NE,NYJ,15,35,27.5,4.0,"If I were to tell you that you could have a running back who is locked in for 12 carries per game for the Patriots, including goal-line duties, you'd be all over it, which is precisely what Gillislee has. While his yards per carry isn't what it was with the Bills, know that he's faced eight or more defenders in the box on 48 percent of his carries, tied with Leonard Fournette for the highest percentage in the league. Through five weeks, the Jets have allowed five touchdowns to running backs (three rushing, two receiving). "
28,Theo Riddick,DET,NO,20,37,29.5,3.3,"Riddick has received the ninth-most targets among running backs with 26, but has largely been a fantasy disappointment this season. He has a chance to have a big game on Sunday against the Saints, however, as New Orleans struggles against pass-catching backs. They've allowed 32 receptions and 303 yards receiving, both second-most in the NFL. If the Saints grab a lead, expect Riddick to be heavily involved in the passing game and exploit the Saints' biggest weakness on defense."
29,Tarik Cohen,CHI,BAL,12,42,29.7,5.4,"Cohen has seen his percentage of snaps drop significantly over the last several weeks, and he's seen only about a quarter of the snaps in each of the Bears' last two games. Benny Cunningham is thought to be a solid pass protector, and with rookie Mitchell Trubisky under center, it's possible that Cohen will continue to lose work to Cunningham. The Ravens haven't been an incredibly tough matchup for opposing running backs, but with Cohen's usage trending significantly downward, he's simply not a viable play on Sunday."
30,Elijah McGuire,NYJ,NE,19,54,31.1,7.0,"This won't last long, but Matt Forte and Bilal Powell are both banged up so that means McGuire is expected to see a big workload in Week 6. If he does extremely well, there is a chance he takes over this job for good, but more likely, he is just a one or two week streamer."
31,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,CAR,18,42,31.7,4.5,"Blount has been superb this season despite scoring only two touchdowns. He's averaging 5.8 yards per carry, and has been even better than that since Darren Sproles went down with season-ending injuries. But the Panthers are stingy against opposing running backs, holding every opposing runner to fewer than 10 fantasy points in standard leagues. At home, Carolina is likely to put up some points, which could lead to a negative game script and relegate Blount to more of a bench role. With several teams on bye, Blount still makes a borderline RB2, but he'll likely need a touchdown to be a worthy start. "
32,Frank Gore,IND,TEN,26,46,32.4,3.8,"The Colts simply cannot afford to have Frank Gore continue to drag this offense into the gutter with his 3.2 yards per carry that offers zero splash-play potential. Since joining the Colts, he's averaged just 3.73 yards per carry and scored 12 touchdowns on 598 carries.  The Titans are actually one of the best teams at stopping the run over the last few years, allowing just six rushing touchdowns in each of the last two seasons. Gore is just a boring RB4. "
33,Shane Vereen,NYG,DEN,16,50,32.9,5.5,"Vereen is going to get more work going forward simply by virtue of the lack of receiving options for the Giants. As we saw from the end of the Chargers game, the Giants pretty much have to use Vereen as a pass-catching option consistently going forward. The Broncos are elite against opposing running backs, but they've allowed three running backs to catch at least four passes against them. That means Vereen could have RB3 value in PPR leagues, though he's not much of a consideration in standard formats. "
34,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,HOU,27,43,34.7,4.2,"Crowell is handcuffing this franchise, running with zero urgency, creating no yards of his own, and lacks the game-breaking potential that Johnson brings to the table. His 3.1 yards per carry ranks sixth-worst among the 44 running backs who've totaled at least 30 carries. Even against a downgraded Texans defense, Crowell belongs on fantasy benches."
35,Wayne Gallman,NYG,DEN,19,52,36.3,5.7,"Gallman split work with Orleans Darkwa on Sunday against the Chargers, though may have been on the short side of the platoon had Darkwa not dealt with a calf injury. Gallman saw 26 snaps to Darkwa's 20, and gained 57 rushing yards on 11 attempts and caught five passes for 25 yards. Darkwa is considered ""day to day"" with the injury, so Gallman has a real chance to take over the job going forward, but it's not a great situation. For one, the Giants' receivers have been decimated by injuries, which should allow opposing to defenses to key in on the running game. Second, the Giants' upcoming schedule is awful, with games in Denver and hosting the Seahawks, followed by a bye. Add Gallman, certainly, but even if he gets 75 percent of the snaps going forward, he'll likely be an RB3 at best."
36,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,PHI,27,50,36.6,4.0,"Despite being relatively ineffective, Stewart continues to see significant touches, getting at least 12 carries in every game and 18 in Week 5. The Eagles present a tough challenge - they allow the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs and give up just 3.4 yards per carry. Stewart's high volume keep him in play as a Flex most weeks, but with no rushing touchdowns on the season, he's on the fringes of fantasy relevance."
37,Samaje Perine,WAS,SF,23,64,40.0,10.5,"Perine has been woeful whenever he's gotten the opportunity to see significant work, but it's going to be difficult to ignore him against the 49ers on Sunday if Rob Kelley doesn't suit up, as expected. Opponents have averaged almost 33 rushing attempts per game against San Francisco, and they give up the third-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. If Kelley misses the game, consider Perine a Flex option with upside."
38,Ty Montgomery,GB,MIN,12,56,37.4,8.9,"Montgomery has been practicing in full this week, and it looks like he might suit up against the Vikings. Unfortunately, Aaron Jones' performance last week against the Cowboys has changed the landscape of the Packers backfield, and Montgomery surely won't be returning to a full-time role. It's a tough matchup in any event - the Vikings have allowed just one rushing touchdown and allow the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs. With Montgomery unlikely to be at full strength and probably in a time share, he's barely a borderline RB3 in the tough matchup."
39,Matt Breida,SF,WAS,29,50,39.7,4.0,"Breida saw a shocking amount of work on Sunday against the Colts, out-snapping Carlos Hyde  (36-34) and receiving 13 touches (gaining 49 yards rushing and 22 yards receiving). Although it seemed that Breida's involvement was because of Hyde's hip injury, Kyle Shanahan said that he was simply going with the ""hot hand."" It's entirely uncertain how the 49ers' backfield situation will break down next week, but Breida is an immediate add for all teams. Hyde is generally brittle and he's been battling his hip injury for several weeks, and the 49ers coaching staff has never been enamored with him. Breida likely isn't a start next week against the Redskins absent Hyde missing the game, but he's a fine long-term stash. "
40,Latavius Murray,MIN,GB,27,61,40.7,5.3,"Murray averaged just 2.6 yards per carry against the Bears on Monday, and Jerick McKinnon quickly established himself as the lead back in Minnesota. But Murray isn't going away, and should continue to get double-digit touches each week, including the goal-line carries. The Packers aren't particularly tough on opposing running backs, but it's difficult to consider starting Murray unless you're desperate, given his performance last week and McKinnon's ascendance. Consider him a high-end RB4 with a chance for a touchdown."
41,Marlon Mack,IND,TEN,31,59,40.8,4.6,"Mack is the top pickup of the week unless somehow Aaron Jones is still available. He isn't technically the starter yet, but he is the best runner in the Colts offense and can be a complete three-down player. When Andrew Luck comes back, we could be looking at a high-end RB2 if Mack does take the job."
42,Alex Collins,BAL,CHI,30,55,41.3,5.0,"Buck Allen is still there and getting 15+ carries per game and Terrance West will be back eventually, but as long as Collins continues to get double-digit touches and performing well, he has to spark some intrigue. He isn't quite startable yet, but with the way he is playing, that may shortly change, just so long as he doesn't fumble his opportuity away."
43,Jamaal Charles,DEN,NYG,23,55,41.7,5.5
44,Adrian Peterson,ARI,TB,23,66,44.2,7.0,"AP might not start right away, but he is a good bet to be the starter for at least a handful of weeks. He won't be able to do much behind this offensive line, but with plenty of touches, especially on the goal-line, he should be an every week start eventually."
45,Matt Forte,NYJ,NE,20,74,45.3,11.9
46,Derrick Henry,TEN,IND,33,58,45.0,4.5
47,Orleans Darkwa,NYG,DEN,38,62,48.2,5.6,"Although everyone thought Wayne Gallman was supposed to be the big pickup in the Giants backfield, it was Darkwa who had the better fantasy day, gaining 69 yards on eight carries, including a 23-yard touchdown. Darkwa was out-snapped and out-touched by Gallman, but that was likely due to a calf injury he suffered on his touchdown run. He's considered ""day to day"" right now, but he obviously earned himself at least a timeshare when healthy. His immediate value is particularly uncertain, however, as the Giants face a rested Broncos team, followed by the Seahawks and then their bye week in the next three weeks. Considering his injury and a daunting upcoming schedule, Darkwa is not someone to blow your free agent budget on. "

52,D'Onta Foreman,HOU,CLE,42,58,50.7,3.8,"Foreman is never going to get enough work to rely on every week unless Miller gets an injury. but this week, he could get double-digit carries in what looks to be a blow out over the Browns."
53,Jalen Richard,OAK,LAC,44,60,51.0,3.9
54,Chris Ivory,JAC,LAR,36,64,51.9,5.2
55,Austin Ekeler,LAC,OAK,39,65,52.3,5.5
56,Corey Clement,PHI,CAR,39,62,51.9,4.7,"Clement wasn't asked to do much last week against the Cardinals in taking over for an injured Wendell Smallwood, rushing just seven times for 17 yards and catching one pass for 22 yards. Smallwood is questionable for Thursday's game against the Panthers, but seems unlikely to suit up. Given Clement's small role in Week 5, however, he's impossible to trust against a solid Panthers rush defense. He's an option in only the deepest of leagues, even if Smallwood indeed misses the game."
