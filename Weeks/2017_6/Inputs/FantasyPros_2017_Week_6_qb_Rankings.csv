Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Tom Brady,NE,NYJ,1,5,1.4,0.8,"Brady is the clear-cut top QB of the week with a strong matchup against the Jets and Aaron Rodgers on the road at Minnesota. The Pats have been throwing the ball quite a bit more this season too, so you can bet on 300 yards and multiple touchdowns."
2,Aaron Rodgers,GB,MIN,1,9,2.6,1.2,"Rodgers has been superb this season, as usual, and he's now thrown 10 touchdown passes with just one interception over his last three games. He'll get one of his tougher tests this Sunday in Minnesota, as the Vikings have allowed the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and allow just 7.13 yards per attempt. But Rodgers had a field day last season against the Vikings, throwing for five touchdowns and running for two more against just a single interception. He's obviously matchup proof, and makes one of the top options in Week 6."
3,Drew Brees,NO,DET,1,7,2.7,1.1,"Brees is in the midst of a typically excellent season, completing 69.1% of his passes with eight touchdowns through four games. He'll take on a tough Lions defense that allows the eighth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this weekend. But off a bye and at home, there's simply no doubting Brees, and he's a fairly obvious top-five play here."
4,Deshaun Watson,HOU,CLE,1,7,4.0,1.2,"You don't need me to tell you what Watson has done the last few weeks, throwing nine touchdowns on just 65 pass attempts. Now he gets a matchup with the Browns, who have allowed multiple touchdowns in 25 of their last 31 games, dating back to 2015. On top of his passing, Watson has averaged 40.8 rushing yards and 0.5 touchdowns on the ground.  "
5,Kirk Cousins,WAS,SF,3,12,6.0,1.5,"Cousins had a very solid game against the Chiefs in Arrowhead Stadium in Week 4, and could have had a monstrous day had Josh Doctson held onto a late pass in the end zone. Now, coming off his bye and against the 49ers, Cousins may be in line for a huge day. The 49ers are coming off back-to-back overtime games, and this will be their third straight road game. Jordan Reed appears healthy and ready to go, so Cousins' receiving group should be at or close to full strength. Expect a huge game from Cousins here, making him a borderline top-five play."
6,Matt Ryan,ATL,MIA,2,18,6.1,2.2,"Ryan has been a disappointment from a fantasy perspective so far this season, with just five touchdowns and five interceptions. But Sunday is a prime chance for him to redeem himself. Ryan typically performs well off a bye, averaging 260 passing yards with 12 touchdowns over his last five games in that situation. While the Dolphins haven't been particularly generous to opposing quarterbacks (they've allowed the 10th-fewest fantasy points to the position), that's due much more to teams not needing to throw against them in light of their abysmal offense. With Julio Jones back to closer to full strength, the Falcons surely want to get their passing game straightened out, and Ryan should throw early and often. He makes a rock-solid QB1. "
7,Cam Newton,CAR,PHI,1,9,6.2,1.4,"Newton's fantasy prospects were on life support after the first few games of the season, but he has rebounded the last two weeks, totaling 671 passing yards with six touchdowns and an interception, and adding 44 rushing yards and a touchdown. The Eagles are decent against opposing quarterbacks, allowing the 13th-most fantasy points to the position, but they've allowed the third-most passing yards and have struggled more lately. In a home game on Thursday night, Newton should continue his recent string of elite fantasy performances."
8,Matthew Stafford,DET,NO,5,15,8.5,1.8,"Stafford was clearly hobbled last week against the Panthers, and, although he'll play this week against the Saints, his mobility may be affected. The Saints have actually been less than terrible against opposing quarterbacks, allowing just the 11th-most fantasy points to the position. But Stafford's recent history in New Orleans is outstanding (nearly 600 passing yards and five touchdowns in his last two games there), and this game has enormous shootout potential. Unless he seems severely limited leading up the game, Stafford has to be considered a top-10 play here."
9,Jameis Winston,TB,ARI,4,18,10.0,1.9,"The matchup with the Cardinals is interesting considering they defend opposing No. 1 wide receivers and tight ends very well, Winston's favorite targets. The Cardinals have been really hit-or-miss against quarterbacks, allowing 22.9 or more points on three separate occasions, and holding the other two quarterbacks to less than nine fantasy points. This game taking place in Arizona has me somewhat concerned, but not enough to completely fade Winston. Consider him a high-end QB2 for this game who isn't as safe as you'd think."
10,Carson Palmer,ARI,TB,7,23,10.3,2.3,"Palmer probably isn't going to survive the season at this rate, as he's on pace for 726 pass attempts and is getting hit routinely by pass-rushers. But his fantasy prospects remain at least serviceable, as he's on pace for 5,034 passing yards, which would be a career-high. He'll draw the Bucs this weekend, and there have been few more favorable matchups for an opposing quarterback this season, as Tampa Bay allows the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Given that it's a home game and that the Arizona receiving group is fully healthy, Palmer should once again surpass 40 pass attempts, and should be a borderline QB1. "
11,Philip Rivers,LAC,OAK,4,17,11.2,2.0,Rivers has at least 17 fantasy points in 4 out of 5 contests this season and is averaging 40 passes per game over the last four games. He is a top 10 QB this week with a shootout expected in Oakland between two strong offenses.
12,Carson Wentz,PHI,CAR,6,16,11.8,1.9,"Wentz absolutely torched the Cardinals in Week 5, throwing for 304 yards and four touchdowns. He'll have a much tougher task in Week 6 in Carolina. The Panthers have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, which includes matchups against Drew Brees and Tom Brady. Perhaps most importantly, Lane Johnson will miss this game with a concussion, and no player was more integral to Wentz's success last year than Johnson. Wentz has earned your trust enough to be a starter this week, but the game doesn't set up particularly well for him."
13,Alex Smith,KC,PIT,7,19,12.3,2.0,"Alex Smith may be the NFL MVP at this point in the season, but the matchup isn't strong enough to make him a must-start this week. While Pittsburgh hasn't gone against the strongest QBs (see Bortles last week), they have been shutting down the pass this season."
14,Jacoby Brissett,IND,TEN,7,22,14.8,2.2
15,Derek Carr,OAK,LAC,9,20,14.8,1.9,"The Chargers have just 1 win this season, but their pass defense is quite strong. You are better off keeping Carr on the bench this week until we see that he is actually healthy or in a better matchup than what we will see Sunday."
16,Marcus Mariota,TEN,IND,4,31,16.1,3.5
17,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,KC,9,24,17.3,3.0,"Don't give up on Big Ben quite yet, the Jaguars have surrendered just 5.5 fantasy points per game this season. He should bounce back just fine against the Chiefs, who without Eric Berry, have been a bottom 6 pass defense this year. Plus, Big Ben torched them for 32 fantasy points last season."
18,Trevor Siemian,DEN,NYG,12,26,17.9,2.1,"Siemian had a few nice weeks, and while the Giants are terrible, they are actually competent at defending the pass. It is much more likely that C.J. Anderson will have a huge game, but if you need a steamer, Siemian is a solid QB2."
19,Josh McCown,NYJ,NE,11,24,18.6,1.9,"In the absolute worst case scenario of a standard 1 QB league, McCown is a decent pickup this week. New England has been giving up loads of fantasy points each game this season, and with the expected game script, McCown should throw the ball plenty."
20,Case Keenum,MIN,GB,15,27,19.5,2.1,"Keenum rescued the Vikings on Monday night against the Bears, taking over for Sam Bradford in the middle of the game and giving the Vikings offense some life. Keenum has been surprisingly effective in limited work this season, with four touchdowns and no interceptions. He'll take on a solid Packers pass defense that allows the 11th-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this weekend, but there have been cracks lately, as two of the past three opposing quarterbacks have scored at least 20 fantasy points against Green Bay. The Vikings will surely need significant points to come away with a victory here, and Keenum should throw enough to make him a potential streaming option, though one that falls outside of the QB1 range in most leagues."
21,Kevin Hogan,CLE,HOU,10,28,21.1,2.9
22,Brian Hoyer,SF,WAS,15,25,21.0,2.2,"Hoyer exploded last week against the Colts, throwing for 353 yards and two touchdowns. He'll have tougher sledding this week against the Redskins, though it's worth noting that the Washington pass defense struggles without Josh Norman, as they'll likely be this weekend. Don't expect a repeat performance from last week, but chasing points, Hoyer is a good bet to score at least one touchdown here, putting him as a low-end QB2."
23,Joe Flacco,BAL,CHI,18,28,23.3,2.0
24,Jared Goff,LAR,JAC,17,30,24.7,2.0,"Goff struggled mightily against the Seahawks last week, turning the ball over three times. Things should only get worse in this week's matchup against the Jaguars, as Jacksonville allows the fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks by a large margin (just 5.5 fantasy points allowed per game to quarterbacks). Sean McVay is an offensive genius, but it's doubtful that even he can devise a game plan that makes Goff a viable quarterback play in any league this week. Absent deep two-quarterback leagues, Goff is a sit here."
25,Blake Bortles,JAC,LAR,17,28,23.5,1.8
26,Jay Cutler,MIA,ATL,20,29,25.7,2.1
27,Eli Manning,NYG,DEN,20,29,26.7,1.6,"It's hard to envision any scenario that would force a fantasy owner to start Manning this week. He's generally struggled this season, is playing in Denver against an elite and rested pass defense, and will be without his three top receivers. It's hard to envision Manning having even the slightest success in this game, and he is probably the least attractive option of any starting quarterback this week."
28,Mitch Trubisky,CHI,BAL,21,29,26.3,1.6,"Trubisky had an uneven debut, looking confident and poised in the beginning of the game before the Vikings adjusted and put pressure on him. The future looks bright for the rookie, but perhaps not as bright this Sunday in Baltimore. The Ravens allow the fifth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, and, especially in a home game, should make life tough on Trubisky. He's one of the least attractive options in Week 6."
29,Matt Cassel,TEN,IND,25,31,28.6,1.2
30,DeShone Kizer,CLE,HOU,28,31,29.9,0.7
