Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,KC,1,4,1.2,0.7,Brown is the best receiver in football and saw 18 targets against one of the best corners in football last week so he has both an incredible floor and ceiling against the struggling Chiefs' secondary.
2,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,CLE,1,6,2.4,0.9,"You might be tempted to think the Texans will just run all over the Browns, but with how the Browns' run defense has played this year, Watson will need to throw the ball, and when he does, Hopkins is a huge target hog. He should have a big game this week."
3,Julio Jones,ATL,MIA,1,6,2.8,1.0,"The bye week couldn't have come at a better time for Jones, who has battled minor injuries in the early going of the season and left Week 4's game against Buffalo with a hip flexor injury. He's been practicing this week and seems like he'll be a full-go against the Dolphins on Sunday. Jones has still not scored a touchdown yet, but he's already received four end zone targets after getting just six all of last year. Miami hasn't allowed many points to opposing wide receivers (10th-fewest to the position), but they don't have a cornerback who can match up with Jones. He's a WR1 here, as he always is."
4,Michael Thomas,NO,DET,2,14,5.0,2.4,"Thomas has seen at least eight targets in every game this season, and has been every bit the No. 1 wide receiver that the Saints expected him to be. He'll have a tough matchup on Sunday against the Lions and Darius Slay, who held Thomas in check in the teams' matchup last season (two catches for 24 yards in coverage). Thomas is an elite wide receiver, so he'll almost always be a WR1, but expectations should be kept in check."
5,Jordy Nelson,GB,MIN,3,20,7.0,3.6,"Nelson appears to be fully healthy despite missing the final drive of the Packers' win over the Cowboys for some undisclosed reason. He's had an odd season, in that he's already scored six touchdowns but is on pace to total just 736 yards. Nelson will have to deal with a tough Vikings defense, but it's unclear whether he'll have to contend with Xavier Rhodes or Trae Waynes. If it's the former, expectations for Nelson would have to be downgraded, but if it's the latter, the sky is the limit. Considering Nelson's success against the Vikings last season (14 catches for 227 yards and three touchdowns), it seems likely that Rhodes will shadow him, but without definitive word, he should still be considered a rock-solid WR1."
6,T.Y. Hilton,IND,TEN,3,18,7.3,2.6,"While Brisset isn't exactly the best quarterback, even he should have no trouble against this lousy Titans' secondary. The Titans have given up some huge games to opposing wide receivers, so Hilton should be considered a WR1 this week."
7,Keenan Allen,LAC,OAK,2,15,7.7,2.8,"While Allen didn't put together an impressive game against the Giants last week, he still saw 12 targets, but was slowed down by Janoris Jenkins. He should bounce back well in what looks like a potential shootout. "
8,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,TB,2,23,9.0,3.5,"Fitzgerald is one of only three receivers with 50 or more targets on the season, but, other than his game against the Cowboys in Week 3, he's been a disappointment for fantasy purposes. But he should be a major asset this weekend against the Bucs, who allow the most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. They've also allowed the second-most fantasy points to opposing slot receivers, as Robert McClain has struggled most of the season. Given Fitzgerald's target share and the soft matchup, he makes a borderline WR1 here, even in standard leagues."
9,Mike Evans,TB,ARI,4,24,9.8,4.8,"Evans has five or more receptions in every game this season, and now will see a Cardinals defense that allows the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. The issue for Evans is that he will be matched up with Patrick Peterson, who has been dominant against opposing No. 1 wide receivers. Last season in the teams' matchup, Peterson largely shadowed Evans, and held him to four catches for 49 yards and a touchdown, despite a whopping 18 targets. Evans' size always makes him a threat to score and he's a WR1, certainly, but downgrade him a bit in the tough matchup."
10,Chris Hogan,NE,NYJ,4,18,10.1,3.1,"Hogan has been the most consistent receiver in football this year not named Antonio Brown. Gronk should be back in the lineup and take some targets, but Hogan seems to be Brady's top red zone target so far this season so he should be considered a WR1."
11,Brandin Cooks,NE,NYJ,6,25,12.8,3.9,"Cooks has huge upside every week, but he only has over 8 fantasy points once so far this season. Granted, the matchup still makes him a WR1 this week, but there is bust potential here, as with every week regarding Cooks."
12,Golden Tate,DET,NO,6,24,13.2,3.5,"Tate has been relatively quiet since the first game of the season, as he's totaled just 160 yards receiving in the four games since. He'll get a chance to rebound on Sunday against a Saints team that allows the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Tate has an incredible history against the Saints, with 24 catches for 344 yards and four touchdowns over his previous three meetings. In a likely shootout, expect one of Tate's strongest efforts of the season and borderline WR1 production."
13,Tyreek Hill,KC,PIT,5,25,13.2,3.9,"Tyreek has been seeing a lot more work this season and now that Chris Conley is out, we can expect him to get another nice little bump in volume. The Steelers' pass defense has been impressive this season, but he is still a high end WR2."
14,Adam Thielen,MIN,GB,5,25,13.9,4.3,"Thielen saw eight targets on Monday night against the Bears, making it the third consecutive game he has received that number of throws. That target volume keeps him relevant in any fantasy matchup, but especially for this Sunday's contest against the Packers. Green Bay is middle of the road against opposing wide receivers, but they've allowed the 10th-most fantasy points to slot wide receivers, where Quinten Rollins has struggled. Thielen destroyed the Packers last season (catching 16 of 21 targets for 243 yards and two touchdowns) and should have another huge effort here."
15,Davante Adams,GB,MIN,6,24,15.2,3.2,"Adams not only surprisingly returned from a concussion to play last week against the Cowboys, but he had a huge game, with seven catches for 66 yards and two touchdowns. Adams' outlook in this game depends on whether Xavier Rhodes sticks with him or Jordy Nelson, but given Nelson's huge history against Minnesota, the safer bet is that Rhodes shadows him. That would leave Adams to contend with Trae Waynes, which is a matchup that Adams should win handily. That leaves Adams as an extremely solid WR2 with tons of upside."
16,Jarvis Landry,MIA,ATL,7,28,15.3,3.8,"He'll match-up with Brian Poole, who has somewhat struggled in coverage this year after playing extremely well to close out 2016. On 29 targets in coverage, he's now allowed 23/233/0 this year. That bodes well for someone like Landry who is averaging almost 11 targets per game. Consider him a solid WR3 in standard leagues and a must-play WR2 in PPR leagues.  "
17,Michael Crabtree,OAK,LAC,7,32,16.2,4.5,"The Chargers' secondary has some strong corners, so Crabtree should slow down a bit in this game, but his volume and production makes him a WR2 even in the worst matchups like what we get this Sunday."
18,Pierre Garcon,SF,WAS,10,27,17.8,3.0,"Garcon has been one of the steadiest receivers in all of fantasy this season, nearly always producing a significant number of catches and solid yardage totals. He should do so again this weekend against a Josh Norman-less Washington team. Garcon will draw either Bashaud Breeland or Quinton Dunbar, neither of whom can contend with him. Garcon's only drawback is his complete inability to score touchdowns, but that doesn't prevent him from being an extremely safe WR2 here."
19,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,CAR,6,26,18.4,4.0,"Jeffery finally gets a break from a tough run of cornerbacks, as he's been matched up with Janoris Jenkins, Casey Hayward, and Patrick Peterson in successive weeks. The Panthers are decent against opposing wide receivers, but lack a true shutdown cornerback, and Jeffery should finally have some room to maneuver. He likely won't need a touchdown to save his fantasy value in this one - expect plenty of catches and yardage for the big receiver, making him a steady WR2 with upside."
20,Emmanuel Sanders,DEN,NYG,10,28,20.0,2.9,"Janoris Jenkins should spend most of his time focused on Demaryius Thomas this week, so Sanders is likely to be the Broncos' top receiver against the Giants sunday night. He is a low-end WR2."
21,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,NYG,12,35,21.8,3.6,"It seems likely that Janoris Jenkins, who has been shutting down everyone this season, should be shadowing Demaryius this weekend. He still ought to be started because his target share has been consistently high, but temper your expectations a little."
22,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,PHI,3,30,22.0,5.3,"Benjamin hasn't seen quite the same volume as Devin Funchess in recent weeks, but he's still been a big part of Cam Newton's resurgence, catching eight of 10 targets for 162 yards and a touchdown over his last two games. He'll now get a dream matchup against Philadelphia on Thursday, as the Eagles allow the second-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. The Eagles' perimeter cornerbacks - Rasul Douglas and Jalen Mills - have particularly struggled, meaning that both Benjamin and Funchess should have big games here. Benjamin makes a rock solid WR2 in this one."
23,Devin Funchess,CAR,PHI,10,30,22.7,3.6,"Funchess looks like he'll be a go for Thursday's game against Philadelphia despite missing some practice this week with a knee injury, and the game could hardly set up better for him. The big receiver has been highly involved in the Panthers offense in recent weeks, seeing 27 targets and catching 18 passes for 181 yards and three touchdowns over his last three games. The Eagles allow the second-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and they particularly struggle against outside wide receivers. Funchess' knee injury is a concern, of course, but his heavy target share and tasty matchup keep him as a borderline WR2 here. "
24,Randall Cobb,GB,MIN,18,39,22.8,3.7,"Cobb surprisingly laid an egg last week against Dallas, totaling just four catches for 29 yards. While owners can expect more production in this week's game against Minnesota, it's unclear just how much better things will get. Cobb has averaged just four catches and 39 yards receiving in his past five matchups against the Vikings, while both Davante Adams and Jordy Nelson have exceled against Minnesota. Cobb is certainly the third best receiving option for the Packers in this one, but should still make a viable WR3 play, despite the risk. Just don't expect a huge game."
25,DeSean Jackson,TB,ARI,10,31,23.6,4.3,"Jackson showed a ton of burst against the Patriots last Thursday, catching five of his nine targets for 106 yards. He'll now take on an Arizona secondary that allows the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Patrick Peterson is elite, but he'll likely be shadowing Mike Evans, leaving Jackson to contend with Justin Bethel. Bethel has allowed four touchdowns in his coverage already, and has struggled mightily this season. Jackson is a high-end WR3 in the soft matchup on Sunday."
26,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,SF,19,40,26.9,3.5,"Pryor caught his first touchdown pass against the Chiefs in Week 4, but still remains largely a disappointment on the season. Coming off a bye, he should be in prime position to have a big game against an exhausted San Francisco defense coming off two overtime games and playing it's third straight road game. The 49ers allow the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and their perimeter cornerbacks, Dontae Johnson and Rashard Robinson, are ranked 108th and 104th, respectively, out of 109 cornerbacks by Pro Football Focus. Whichever one is matched up against Pryor, the big wide receiver should have no issues getting open and producing."
27,Amari Cooper,OAK,LAC,19,40,27.6,3.5,"It's been a tough time for Cooper supporters over the last few weeks, as he's totaled just 23 yards in the last three games combined. Something is going on with him mentally and maybe physically, because we've never seen him struggle this much in his young career. The Chargers also have Casey Hayward, who will likely shadow him in coverage, making him someone to avoid if possible until he rights the ship. "
28,Danny Amendola,NE,NYJ,19,57,29.2,5.2,"Amendola isn't getting much in the way of red zone work, but he has at least 6 receptions in 3 out of 4 games played this season, and should have no trouble accumulating that total against a lackluster Jets secondary this week so plug him into your flex."
29,Rishard Matthews,TEN,IND,18,49,30.7,5.3,"Matthews had a rough week against Miami in Week 5, but he has been steady all season so he ought to be started against a weak Colts' secondary in Week 6."
30,Will Fuller,HOU,CLE,11,43,31.8,5.1,"Fuller is blazing hot in the fantasy world, but it shouldn't keep up, as he has just 6 receptions in 2 games. He does have a great matchup against the Brows, however, so he is a solid flex option."
31,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,NE,27,42,32.6,3.2,"While Kearse may be the top option in the Jets' passing game, he has over 7 fantasy points just once in five games this season. He will consistantly see enough work to be relied upon as a WR5, but he doesn't have the upside of a player like JuJu or Mike WIlliams."
32,John Brown,ARI,TB,22,47,33.6,4.5,"Brown caught a touchdown pass against the Eagles on Sunday, but did little else, catching just two of his seven targets for 26 yards. But the most encouraging thing about Sunday was that Brown played on 48-of-60 snaps, which was significantly more than Jaron Brown (36) and J.J. Nelson (32). Brown's health is the key factor, as he seems likely to be the second-best wide receiver in Arizona so long as he is not hindered by his quadriceps injury. He's a particularly good add with next week's matchup with the Bucs on the horizon, but he should hold solid season-long value if he can remain healthy."
33,Marvin Jones,DET,NO,24,50,33.9,4.3,"Jones saw his highest number of targets, receptions, and yards last week against the Panthers, and his spike in production couldn't come at a better time. The Saints allow the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and the game is expected to be a shootout. Both Jones and Golden Tate should excel here, and Jones' likely increased involvement and the solid matchup should make him a viable WR3 play."
34,Jamison Crowder,WAS,SF,23,53,35.7,6.4,"Crowder has been awful this season, but there's hope that the bye week will help to get him going. For one thing, Jay Gruden has specifically said the Redskins need to get Crowder going more. For another, the 49ers have a terrible secondary, and Crowder should be paired up against K'Waun Williams in the slot, who is ranked 99th out of 109 cornerbacks by Pro Football Focus. Given the matchup and Gruden's comments, Crowder could make a sneaky borderline WR3 here against San Francisco. "
35,Willie Snead,NO,DET,25,59,36.7,6.2,"Snead was held out of Week 4's game against the Dolphins, the first after he was activated from his suspension, with a hamstring injury. It sounds like the bye week has helped him, so he should be active for this week's game against Detroit. Word out of Saints camp is that Snead will be eased back into action, so it would be fair for fantasy owners to take their time before inserting Snead into their starting lineups. But in an expected shootout, Snead should have some value even on a limited snap count, so he can be deployed as a desperation WR3 for owners struggling with byes. "
36,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,CHI,29,62,37.1,6.5,"Jeremy Maclin has been seeing consistent targets, but has failed to top 56 yards in any one game. His matchup with Bryce Callahan isn't a good one, making him a less-than-ideal WR4 in fantasy lineups. The Bears have played some really good wide receivers to this point and have yet to allow more than 93 yards and have allowed just two to hit the 75-yard mark. "
37,Tyrell Williams,LAC,OAK,28,53,37.2,5.0,"Tyrell Williams probably has the best matchup among the Chargers wide receivers, as the Raiders have been prone to big plays over the last two years. He torched them for 117 yards and a touchdown last year in their first meeting last year, but then totaled just 20 yards in the second game when Rivers was playing poorly. I'd trot him out in lineups as a risk/reward high-end WR4 this week and expect results.  "
38,Taylor Gabriel,ATL,MIA,30,58,39.5,6.1,"Gabriel had an impressive effort against the Lions in Week 3 with 79 yards and a touchdown, but he has just five catches for 50 yards in his other three games combined. But the upcoming schedule is incredibly soft, with matchups against the Dolphins, Patriots, and Jets on the horizon. Mohamed Sanu may not be ready to return quite yet in Week 6, so Gabriel has decent short-term value, at the very least, with the upcoming schedule."
39,Martavis Bryant,PIT,KC,25,70,39.8,7.1,"Bryant has just 1 strong week thus far and isn't seeing many targets, but he is getting healthier and has a nice matchup against the Chiefs Sunday afternoon so don't give up on him quite yet. He can be started in your flex spot."
40,Jaron Brown,ARI,TB,30,74,42.4,7.1,"Brown was on fantasy owners' radars in recent weeks after three straight serviceable performances, but Sunday against the Eagles was a step back. He played on just 36 of 60 snaps, significantly less than John Brown, and caught just three passes for 39 yards. Going forward, if all Arizona receivers are healthy, Jaron Brown likely isn't going to have a significant role in fantasy circles, and should likely be only the fourth-most valuable receiver for the Cardinals."
41,Cooper Kupp,LAR,JAC,27,61,43.0,5.6,"Kupp leads the Rams in targets, and is certainly Jared Goff's favorite wide receiver. But Los Angeles will take on a tough Jaguars defense on Sunday, and Jacksonville allows the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. The real strength of the Jacksonville secondary is the perimeter receivers, in that A.J. Bouye and Jalen Ramsey are two of the top-rated cornerbacks by Pro Football Focus. But the Jaguars have actually allowed the second-fewest fantasy points to slot receivers, and Aaron Colvin has been just a tick below Bouye and Ramsey. It's nearly impossible to consider starting any Rams wide receiver in this one, including Kupp."
42,Allen Hurns,JAC,LAR,31,59,43.5,4.9,"Hurns is hit or miss with his big play upside, so while you may not want to trust Bortles, Hurns offers enough potential that you ought to consider streaming him if you are in need of a warm body."
43,Mike Wallace,BAL,CHI,28,62,44.2,5.4,"Many experts around the industry regard Wallace as the top pickup of the week, but nothing has really changed from what we knew he was at the start of the season. He will have 3 or 4 strong performances and the majority of the rest will be duds. Pick him up only if you want to play the guessing game each week."
44,Nelson Agholor,PHI,CAR,29,59,44.4,5.6,"Agholor had an excellent game against the Cardinals, catching four of five targets for 93 yards and a touchdown. But he had been relatively quiet in the three previous games, and the key to success against Arizona is to target all receivers other than the one guarded by Patrick Peterson. Agholor's lack of consistency makes him nothing but a deep-league add, though if he succeeds against Philadelphia on Thursday, fantasy owners should re-evaluate."
45,Robby Anderson,NYJ,NE,29,71,44.9,6.8,"Considering the lack of pressure the Patriots are getting on quarterbacks, you have to wonder if Robby Anderson can get loose down the field a time or two. The Patriots typically remove No.1 targets from the game, but the Jets don't have a clear No. 1 receiver. Anderson leads the team with 29 targets, while Jermaine Kearse has seen 28, and then Jeremy Kerley sits at 17 targets. Because of the lacking pass-rush, the Patriots secondary has allowed three 100-yard games to opposing wide receivers, including speedster Tyreek Hill, Kelvin Benjamin, and another speedster DeSean Jackson. You can do worse for a bye week filler than Anderson, who is an upside WR4. "
46,Marqise Lee,JAC,LAR,39,58,46.6,3.5,"Marqise Lee doesn't have the benefit of Allen Robinson taking away No. 1 cornerbacks anymore and his production is suffering because of it. He's leading the team with 30 targets, but he's turned them into just 15 catches for 208 scoreless yards. He'll see a mix of Trumaine Johnson and Kayvon Webster in coverage, which is not the most daunting of duos, but when you're seeing just three or four targets per game (what Lee has the last two weeks), it's tough to do much of anything. No wide receiver has finished as a WR1 against them this year, and just two wide receivers have finished top-36 in any given week. Lee is just a mediocre WR4/5 option until he starts seeing an uptick in targets. "
47,Ricardo Louis,CLE,HOU,31,63,46.4,6.1,"Louis may have taken over as the top receiver for the Browns. That isn't saying much, but it doesn't make him fantasy relevant. If you need depth, he fits the bill, but there doesn't appear to be much upside here."
48,Sammy Watkins,LAR,JAC,35,59,46.9,6.0,"Watkins has had one good game this season, but has been almost entirely ignored by Jared Goff in the other four. Watkins occasionally seems to not have a full grasp of the playbook, though his lack of targets appears due more to Goff's refusal to target an opposing team's No. 1 cornerback. That certainly does not bode well for Watkins' prospects this week, as he'll be guarded by either A.J. Bouye or Jalen Ramsey, both of whom are lockdown corners. The Jaguars allow the third-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and especially given Watkins' lack of production lately, he's just a WR4 here."
49,Kendall Wright,CHI,BAL,32,60,48.8,5.7,"Wright was certainly Mitchell Trubisky's favorite target among wide receivers, as he was targeted five times on Monday against the Vikings, catching four balls for 46 yards. While he may continue to see significant targets, it's hard to project much success for him in Week 6, as the Bears will travel to Baltimore to take on the Ravens. Baltimore allows the sixth-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and will likely try to focus on taking away one of Trubisky's top targets. Wright is in the WR5 range in standard leagues this week, but closer to the WR4 ranges in PPR leagues."
50,Eric Decker,TEN,IND,36,59,49.7,5.9
51,Ted Ginn,NO,DET,39,71,51.1,5.3
52,Kenny Stills,MIA,ATL,26,66,52.0,8.5
53,J.J. Nelson,ARI,TB,34,73,53.1,7.2,"Nelson again saw the fewest number of snaps of the Arizona wide receivers with just 32 out of 60, but he made them count by catching four of six targets for 80 yards and nearly catching a touchdown.  With John Brown healthy, Nelson is again relegated to being merely a boom or bust play, but the wheel lands on boom a bit more often. He's far from reliable, but he's a decent bye-week filler when you need a home run play."
54,Donte Moncrief,IND,TEN,32,64,52.7,4.6
55,JuJu Smith-Schuster,PIT,KC,34,75,54.3,9.5,"Smith-Schuster has apparently surpassed Martavis Bryant as the #2 wide receiver on the Steelers, but they haven't targeted him enough for everyone to notice. Granted, most passes will still be going to Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, but JuJu is certainly worth owning and if one of them were to get injured, he would become a must-start every single week."
56,Devante Parker,MIA,ATL,25,67,31.9,11.1,"Jay Cutler has been so bad that he just might lose his job in the coming weeks. Their passing attack should be stronger this week against the Falcons' however, and Parker is getting enough work that he should be started in every league."
57,Adam Humphries,TB,ARI,32,64,53.7,5.4,"Humphries has seen 22 targets over the last three games, hauling in 15 of them for 189 yards. He's the fourth option in the Bucs' passing game behind Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, and Cameron Brate, but his number of targets makes him relevant in deep leagues. He's not a league-winner by any means, but he's pretty much a perfect bye-week filler who will give you decent production each week."
58,Roger Lewis,NYG,DEN,37,70,54.7,7.3,"Lewis has one undeniably important quality going for him right now - he's literally the only healthy wide receiver for the Giants. He made the most of his opportunity on Sunday against the Chargers, catching one of his two targets for 29 yards and a touchdown. Although the opportunity should be there for Lewis, at least in the immediate future, he couldn't ask for a much worse upcoming schedule, as the Giants draw a rested Broncos team, followed by the Seahawks and their bye week. It's hard to invest much in a Giants wide receiver, but he's worth an add if you're decimated at the position."
59,Stefon Diggs,MIN,GB,4,30,15.9,9.3,"Diggs is battling a groin injury and did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday, putting his availability for this Sunday's game against the Packers in doubt. If he does suit up, it's impossible to sit him, given his enormous potential and the fact that the Packers may be down Kevin King. Consider him a WR2, but obviously monitor the practice reports and have a backup available just in case."
60,Marquise Goodwin,SF,WAS,44,68,57.6,4.5,"Goodwin had a huge effort against the Colts, with five catches on 11 targets for 116 yards. But he had totaled just 127 yards receiving and nine catches in the four previous games. There's always big-play potential with Goodwin, but as his season has showed, absent a fantastic matchup, he likely won't do much. He's unlikely to have much season-long value."

76,Kamar Aiken,IND,TEN,48,94,78.3,9.5
77,Mike Williams,LAC,OAK,56,98,74.3,8.9,"Williams hasn't had the reps you'd want to see in a rookie making his debut, so it will likely be shakey at first, but this is a young man with significant abilities so don't be surprised if he quickly breaks out. There will be a lot of competition for targets, however, so this is more of a lottery ticket."
78,Tavon Austin,LAR,JAC,53,88,79.3,5.8
79,Brandon Coleman,NO,DET,55,91,73.8,6.9
80,Justin Hardy,ATL,MIA,57,98,73.9,5.8,"Hardy has played in just two games this season, and has caught three of eight targets for just 31 yards, though he does have a touchdown catch. But Mohamed Sanu is banged up, and Matt Ryan needs to throw it to someone. With an incredibly soft upcoming schedule of the Dolphins, Patriots, and Jets, Hardy could be a sneaky add if Sanu has to miss time. His long-term value, however, is next to nothing. "
