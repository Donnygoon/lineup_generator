1,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,IND,1,7,1.9,1.4
2,Minnesota Vikings,MIN,BAL,1,18,2.9,2.9,"The Vikings D/ST has been its typical solid self this season, racking up at least one sack in every game and tallying up seven interceptions. The Ravens allow the 12th-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs this season, and have a banged up receiving group. There should be plenty of opportunities for turnovers against Joe Flacco, making the Vikings one of the top D/ST plays of the week. "
3,Seattle Seahawks,SEA,NYG,1,13,2.9,1.9,"The Seahawks D/ST is coming off two enormous efforts against the Colts (three sacks, an interception, a fumble recovery, and two touchdowns) and the Rams (two sacks, two interceptions, and three fumble recoveries). The Giants aren't particularly generous to opposing D/STs, but without Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall (and potentially Sterling Shepard), the Seahawks defense is likely to be able to put up fantasy points. Consider them a top option this week. "
4,Denver Broncos,DEN,LAC,1,27,5.3,3.4
5,Carolina Panthers,CAR,CHI,2,18,6.2,2.7,"The Panthers secondary has yet to register an interception on the season, which is part of the reason that their D/ST has not been an elite unit thus far. But they should put forth a solid effort in Week 7 against the Bears, who have topped 20 points just twice this season. Luke Kuechly may sit this one out with a concussion, which would take some of the appeal away, but between Julius Peppers, Kawann Short, and Mario Addison, the Panthers D/ST should register plenty of sacks and easily be a top-12 unit this week."
6,Pittsburgh Steelers,PIT,CIN,2,17,6.7,2.3
7,Buffalo Bills,BUF,TB,3,22,7.6,2.8
8,Tennessee Titans,TEN,CLE,1,18,9.2,3.2
9,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,OAK,4,24,9.7,3.6
10,Los Angeles Rams,LAR,ARI,1,20,10.2,3.3,"The Rams get to the opposing quarterback as well as any defense, as they have totaled 20 sacks already this season. Arizona has allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs, and the Cardinals' offensive line is particularly weak. The Rams should be able to get to Carson Palmer plenty, and the D/ST should be a solid starting option. "
11,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,MIN,3,22,10.7,3.8
12,Miami Dolphins,MIA,NYJ,1,20,12.1,3.0
13,New Orleans Saints,NO,GB,1,21,12.4,3.6,"The Saints D/ST has quietly been an elite fantasy option in its last three games, totaling 13 sacks, four interceptions, two fumble recoveries, and three touchdowns. They'll now take on a Packers team that would ordinarily be considered a terrible matchup for opposing D/STs, but suddenly looks promising with Aaron Rodgers sidelined. Brett Hundley threw three interceptions in limited work last week against the Vikings, and the Packers offensive line is struggling. While it's still a bit hard to buy into the Saints D/ST as a guaranteed weekly starter, there's no doubt the unit can be deployed with confidence this week."
14,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,WAS,3,23,13.4,3.6,"The Eagles' weakness is their secondary, but it hasn't stopped their D/ST from being a formidable unit this season. They've averaged nine points per week over the last two games, and will not be playing in a nationally-televised game on Monday night against a Washington team that struggles in pass protection. Fletcher Cox being healthy changes the entire tenor of the defensive line, and they should be able to force Kirk Cousins into some bad decisions. It's not a fantastic matchup by any means, but it's good enough to make the Eagles D/ST a streaming option."
15,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,LAR,8,28,16.1,3.3,"The Cardinals have really struggled on defense this season, with a secondary that, aside from Patrick Peterson, can't stop anyone. The Rams under Sean McVay are excellent as limiting opposing D/STs, allowing the third-fewest fantasy points to the position. After a long trip to London, it's unlikely that the Cardinals will be at their best, making the D/ST a poor play in Week 7. "
16,Cincinnati Bengals,CIN,PIT,7,23,16.5,2.9

20,New York Jets,NYJ,MIA,9,29,18.7,3.2
21,Dallas Cowboys,DAL,SF,4,24,18.0,4.6,"The Cowboys are fresh off their bye, and are hopeful to get Sean Lee back for this week's matchup against the 49ers. Despite struggling on offense for most of the year, San Francisco has not allowed a ton of points to opposing D/STs, and the Cowboys are far from an elite unit. But with rookie C.J. Beathard under center for the 49ers, the Dallas pass rush, led by Demarcus Lawrence, should have a field day. This is one of the rare weeks where the Cowboys D/ST should be usable. "
