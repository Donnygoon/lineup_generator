Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Tom Brady,NE,ATL,1,4,1.1,0.5,"Since the Week 1 struggle, Brady has been firing and should have no issues providing another high-end QB1 performance in this week's shootout at home against Atlanta."
2,Matt Ryan,ATL,NE,1,7,3.1,1.3,"Ryan has been an incredible disappointment this season, with just six touchdowns against six interceptions. But this weekend's matchup is about as good as it gets. The Patriots have allowed the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks by a wide margin, and have allowed the most passing yards and most passing touchdowns in the league. Ryan has undoubtedly been stewing over the Super Bowl since February, and the Falcons will surely try to come out and ""avenge"" the loss. Look for Ryan to finish as a top-five quarterback this week."
3,Dak Prescott,DAL,SF,1,7,3.3,1.4,"Prescott has had an elite fantasy season in 2017, and it should continue this weekend against the 49ers. San Francisco allows the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, and Prescott had his biggest game of the season last year coming off the Cowboys' bye. He's been on a serious roll of late, accounting for multiple touchdowns in each of his last four games and at least three touchdowns in each of his last three games. He's one of the top starts of the week."
4,Drew Brees,NO,GB,1,8,3.5,1.6,"The excitement over Brees' matchup against the Packers has waned a bit, now that Aaron Rodgers' injury has reduced the chance of a shootout. But, it's a good bet that Brees will still put up his typical numbers. The Packers have been solid against opposing quarterbacks, but that's much more due to their ability to keep opposing teams off the field. Green Bay is getting healthier in the secondary, but it shouldn't matter here. Brees is always a top option at quarterback, and remains one in Week 7."
5,Carson Wentz,PHI,WAS,3,9,5.3,1.3,"Wentz got the fantasy community's attention in Week 1 against the Redskins, passing for 307 yards and two touchdowns. He should have similar success this weekend against Washington, as the game is in Philadelphia on Monday night. The Redskins have been decent against opposing quarterbacks, but far less so since Josh Norman was injured. Bashaud Breeland may also miss this game, further adding to the appeal of both Wentz and the Eagles receivers. Wentz has thrown seven touchdown passes over his past two games, and should keep rolling on Monday. He's a borderline top-five option in Week 7."
6,Kirk Cousins,WAS,PHI,3,14,6.1,2.0,"Cousins has been outstanding this season, though it's worth noting that his worst game of the year came in Week 1 against these same Eagles. Philadelphia isn't great against opposing quarterbacks, allowing the 11th-most fantasy points to the position, but Cousins hasn't performed well historically against them. Cousins' performance this season puts him firmly in the QB1 category in nearly every matchup, however, and should be started with confidence here."
7,Cam Newton,CAR,CHI,3,12,7.4,1.5,"Newton reverted to his old form last Thursday against the Eagles, struggling with accuracy (three interceptions) but making things happen with his legs (71 yards rushing and a touchdown). The worrisome part is that Newton appeared to hurt his shoulder diving for the end zone in the second half of the game, and he clearly struggled to throw the ball after that. Even assuming there are no residual effects, it's not a fantastic matchup this week against Chicago, as the Bears have allowed the ninth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. His rushing ability gives him a solid floor, but temper expectations some."
8,Marcus Mariota,TEN,CLE,4,14,8.3,2.0,"With another week to heal up, Mariota should be more himself, though he shouldn't need to run so much against the Browns defense. They have now allowed multiple passing touchdowns in 27 of their last 32 games, including three or more in 10 of their last 21 games. Three of the last four quarterbacks they've played have finished as top-four quarterbacks for that week, which has included Jacoby Brissett, Andy Dalton, and Deshaun Watson. Mariota needs to be started as a QB1. "
9,Russell Wilson,SEA,NYG,3,14,8.4,1.7,"Wilson may not survive the season given the state of his offensive line, particularly now that Luke Joeckel will miss a significant period of time, but he's healthy now and producing for fantasy owners. The Giants allow the ninth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks despite their strong secondary, and they certainly could be due for a letdown effort after last week's shocking upset over the Broncos. Wilson has typically put up huge numbers only when his team is trailing and he's in catchup mode, and that's unlikely to be the case this week. But he should provide solid QB1 numbers, albeit likely without the ceiling that he usually brings."
10,Alex Smith,KC,OAK,5,18,10.0,1.8,"It was only a matter of time before the lack of playmakers on the offense showed up with Alex Smith. It's not really his fault, but if opponents take Travis Kelce out of the game, he's going to struggle to find other reliable options - it's the reason he targeted running backs on seven of his 34 attempts last week. Fortunately, the Raiders haven't been able to generate much of a pass rush this year, which is huge because Smith has been under duress this year as the fourth-most pressured quarterback. They also struggle to defend tight ends, which is where we know Smith wants to go. The Raiders look solid on paper against quarterbacks, but the collection they've played isn't what I'd call great. Smith should be able to produce solid QB2 numbers in this game. "
11,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,TB,8,20,11.7,2.0,"Tyrod hasn't been his normal self this season, likely because Sammy Watkins, Charles Clay and Robert Woods are now all missing. Even so, he has been a QB1 each of the past two seasons, so if you are looking to replace Aaron Rodgers, he is a safe investment to fill in."
12,Carson Palmer,ARI,LAR,7,16,11.8,1.8,"Palmer had his best game of the season last week against the Bucs, completing nearly 82 percent of his passes and throwing for three touchdowns. He'll now take on a Rams defense against which he had some success last year, averaging 272 passing yards and two touchdowns in two games. The Rams have been solid against opposing quarterbacks this season, but with a full arsenal of healthy wide receivers at his disposal, Palmer should be able to put up enough production to make him a borderline QB1."
13,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,CIN,6,21,14.4,2.6,"If it weren't for the 50 yard touchdown to Brown that should have been picked off, Big Ben would have three straight lousy weeks to his name. This week should be better, but with the way he is playing, you are better off avoiding starting him if you can."
14,Derek Carr,OAK,KC,6,22,15.0,2.5,"The Chiefs defense has gone from one to avoid throwing against, to one that you can find mismatches throughout their secondary. The injuries to Eric Berry and Steven Nelson have showed up big, as they've now allowed 10 passing scores in the last five games, which included five to Deshaun Watson in Week 5. The only quarterback who failed to throw for at least 7.2 yards per attempt against them this season was Philip Rivers, and he always struggles against the Chiefs. "
15,Jared Goff,LAR,ARI,11,26,15.1,2.7,"Goff didn't do much against the Jaguars on Sunday, completing just 11 of 21 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown, but the Rams won again. He should get a much easier task on Sunday against a Cardinals team that is allowing the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks.  The Arizona secondary has been abysmal outside of Patrick Peterson, and Peterson may be forced to miss this game with an injury, which could further boost Goff's stock. He's still not quite in QB1 territory, but Goff is a sturdy QB2 in Week 7."
16,Brett Hundley,GB,NO,9,28,15.4,3.0,"Hundley was pressed into emergency duty for the Packers on Sunday when Aaron Rodgers left the game with a broken collarbone, and he struggled. He threw for just 157 yards and three interceptions, though he added a touchdown. It's tough to place too much blame on Hundley given the tough matchup against Minnesota and the lack of preparation time, but it's equally difficult to be optimistic. Given his weapons, Hundley can likely find his way into the QB2 discussion, but don't count on him for more just yet."
17,Jameis Winston,TB,BUF,11,34,17.0,3.9,"It would probably be wise for the Bucs to just sit Jameis Winston to preserve his throwing shoulder, because, you know, that's kind of important for him to succeed. The matchup against the Bills isn't a great one, either, as they have now held five of five quarterbacks to less than 14 fantasy points. Keep in mind that they've played against Andy Dalton, Matt Ryan, and Cam Newton this year. No matter which quarterback plays - Winston or Ryan Fitzpatrick - they're not going to be a recommended start in fantasy leagues.  "
18,Philip Rivers,LAC,DEN,13,23,18.2,1.8,"Rivers has been passing the ball a ton all season and has five of six strong performances as a result. This week is a tough enough matchup that he isn't expected to be a QB1. With that said, you can justify streaming him for lack of better options."
19,Blake Bortles,JAC,IND,13,28,19.4,3.1,"In years past, Blake Bortles has made his living on garbage time. Now that he's failed to throw the ball more than 35 times all season, you won't see him near the top of fantasy leaderboards. With that being said, we have to at least consider him against the Colts this week. Through six weeks, there hasn't been a single quarterback to play against them who finished outside of the top 14 quarterbacks for that particular week. They're allowing 8.5 yards per attempt on the season, which has led to allowing 307.7 passing yards per game. If Fournette isn't 100 percent, the Jaguars may be forced to lean on Bortles a bit more. He's in the high-end QB2 conversation this week.  "
20,Josh McCown,NYJ,MIA,13,25,20.5,2.6
21,C.J. Beathard,SF,DAL,15,30,21.7,2.9,"Beathard was unspectacular after taking over for Brian Hoyer on Sunday against the Redskins, completing 19 of 36 pass attempts for 245 yards with a touchdown and an interception. But he did almost lead the 49ers to a comeback victory, and showed that he has a strong arm and should get a shot as the starter. He'll now take on a Cowboys team that gives up the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, and should have the 49ers chasing points. Beathard is hardly an exciting option, but he should make a decent QB2 on Sunday."
22,Andy Dalton,CIN,PIT,13,26,21.0,2.2,"Pittsburgh has been shutting down the pass this season, so this is not the week to stream Dalton, who has been playing better latley, but not enough to warrant a must-start in any matchup."
23,Trevor Siemian,DEN,LAC,16,28,22.1,2.1
24,Case Keenum,MIN,BAL,15,28,23.5,2.3,"Keenum has been a serviceable real-life quarterback, but he has done little in fantasy lately, throwing just two touchdown passes over his previous three games. He'll now get a tough test against the Ravens, who allow the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, an impressive stat considering Blake Bortles demolished them in London a few weeks back. Keenum may also be without Stefon Diggs in this one, and so makes a particularly unappealing option. Outside two-QB leagues, and even in many of them, Keenum is not a fantasy option."
25,DeShone Kizer,CLE,TEN,17,31,25.3,3.5
26,Jacoby Brissett,IND,JAC,14,29,26.3,2.2,"Brissett has had a few impressive games, but even if Andrew Luck doesn't come back until after the bye, the Colts draw four of the toughest pass defenses in football during that time, so there is virtually no appeal to picking him up."
27,Ryan Fitzpatrick,TB,BUF,14,32,27.9,3.8
28,Jay Cutler,MIA,NYJ,15,30,26.5,2.4
29,Eli Manning,NYG,SEA,19,30,26.7,2.1,"Manning somehow survived a very difficult matchup in Denver last week, but there's no way he can be trusted in any matchup with the Giants' lack of receiving depth. That's particularly true this week against a Seahawks team that has allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and is coming off a bye. Manning falls outside even the QB2 range this week, even if Sterling Shepard returns, as expected."
30,Mitch Trubisky,CHI,CAR,24,31,28.7,1.6,"Trubisky led the Bears to a win over the Ravens in Week 6, though he did so largely by staying out of the way and not turning the ball over. It's clear that the Bears are trying to limit his pass attempts, as he threw just 16 times last week, and that will cap his upside. But he's rushed for 54 yards in his first two games, and has a touchdown in both games, which suggests that he won't hurt you if you're forced to start him. The Panthers aren't great against opposing quarterbacks, though they aren't terrible either. For now, consider Trubisky a borderline QB2, but chances are you'll have better options for Week 7."
31,Kevin Hogan,CLE,TEN,23,34,29.7,2.6
