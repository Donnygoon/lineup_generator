Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,CIN,1,4,1.5,0.9,"Brown has over 300 yards in the past two weeks. This week, he gets a much easier secondary with potentially two cornerbacks out for the game. He is a must play even in DFS cash games and GPP."
2,A.J. Green,CIN,PIT,1,15,2.7,1.9,"Green was on fire before his bye with 51 points in three weeks. This week, his matchup with the Steelers will be a real challenge, as they are among the best in the league against the pass, but he should still be regarded as a top five receiver."
3,Julio Jones,ATL,NE,1,7,2.9,1.2,"Jones has had a very poor year so far, as he has received far fewer targets than expected and has yet to score a touchdown. The Patriots present a fantastic matchup on paper, as they allow the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. But you know that Bill Belichick likes to take away the opposing team's top option, so Jones will be the focal point of the defense. Still, given how the Patriots defense has played this year, it's impossible to consider Jones anything other than a strong WR1."
4,Michael Thomas,NO,GB,2,10,4.4,1.7,"Thomas somehow missed out on all the scoring in Week 6 against the Lions, being held to just three catches and 11 yards. The Saints defense put up plenty of points, and Thomas was matched up with Darius Slay, which likely led to Drew Brees not forcing him targets. This week should be a different story against the Packers, even though they are expected to get Kevin King back from a concussion. Thomas is not the type of receiver who can get completely shut down by a cornerback, and even if he was, King does not have that talent level. Expect Brees to try to make up for last week with Thomas against a beatable secondary, and start Thomas as a top-five option."
5,Mike Evans,TB,BUF,3,14,5.8,1.9,"Evans has had a bizarre season, in that he hasn't been efficient at all, but is seeing such a high volume of targets (47) and scoring so many touchdowns (three), that he's providing fantasy owners with almost exactly what they expected. The Bills are solid, though not elite, against opposing wide receivers, but lack a true shutdown corner, which should mean positive things for Evans. Regardless of whether it's Ryan Fitzpatrick or Jameis Winston throwing him the ball, Evans should again see plenty of targets and finish as a WR1. "
6,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,LAR,1,14,5.9,2.5,"Fitzgerald had a monster effort in Week 6 against the Bucs, catching 10 of his 11 targets for 138 yards and a score. This week won't be so easy, as the Rams allow the sixth-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Nickell Robey-Coleman has been particularly effective against slot receivers, so the matchup is especially tough for Fitzgerald. But he has 62 targets already this season, and that type of volume is worth betting on every week, even though Fitzgerald has been inconsistent. Consider him a borderline WR1 in London this weekend."
7,Dez Bryant,DAL,SF,2,10,6.5,1.3,"Bryant has succeeded against several tough cornerbacks this season, so he should have no trouble against the 49ers this weekend. Both Dontae Johnson and Rashard Robinson have struggled mightily the season, and the 49ers have allowed the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Bryant should be in line for a big day and be a borderline top-five option this weekend."
8,Brandin Cooks,NE,ATL,5,18,10.0,2.7,"Cooks has only scored in on game this season, ironically against the Texans, so owners might be discouraged. Don't sell low on him and be sure to start him every week, as he is still a definite WR1."
9,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,LAC,3,22,10.9,3.8,"Thomas has been limited in practice this week with a calf issue, but he should be good to go Sunday against the Chargers. Even if it isn't the prettiest matchup, with Emmanuel Sandrs out, he should see upwards of a dozen targets."
10,Michael Crabtree,OAK,KC,4,27,11.9,3.8,"Crabtree already has 5 touchdowns on the season and at least 80 yards in 3 of 5 games so far this season. He is a high-end WR2 most weeks and a must-start in every matchup, especially against a weak pass defense like Kansas City."
11,Chris Hogan,NE,ATL,6,23,12.1,3.3,"Hogan's rate of production seemed to be unsustainable, but he just kept scoring points so last week's bust was a surprise. Expect a bounce back in Week 7 against the Falcons, where he should again return to being a WR1."
12,Jarvis Landry,MIA,NYJ,7,21,12.5,3.2,"Jarvis Landry is now up to 57 targets after five games, so it shouldn't surprise you to know that he's seen at least 10 targets in four different games. He's somehow failed to top 78 yards on all those targets, but he's now scored in the last two games while Parker has been sidelined. His matchup with Buster Skrine is the best on the field, making him a solid low-end WR2 in PPR formats and a decent WR3 in standard formats. Skrine is somewhat of an all-or-nothing cornerback who will get punished if he misses a pass-breakup. The 152 yards he has allowed after the catch rank as the third-most in the league.  "
13,Adam Thielen,MIN,BAL,4,22,13.3,3.6,"Adam Thielen is the only wide receiver in the NFL who has at least five catches in every game, though he's yet to find the end zone. He's got a solid matchup this week, as the Ravens have trusted Ladarius Webb to defend slot receivers and it hasn't gone well, as Rashard Higgins posted 7/95/0, Allen Hurns had 3/20/1, and JuJu Smith-Schuster had 3/47/1 against them. Considering we know the catches are going to come regardless, it may be a good game for him to get his first touchdown. Thielen is a solid WR3 play. "
14,Doug Baldwin,SEA,NYG,6,28,13.6,3.8,"The Giants announced earlier this week that Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie would be re-joining the team for this week's game, which is quite fitting because of the matchup they would have had without him. Doug Baldwin will see him in coverage, so you obviously want to downgrade him a bit. Rodgers-Cromartie is one of the better slot cornerbacks in the game and Baldwin has really struggled to get much going this year. Outside of the one game against the Titans where he totaled 105 yards and a touchdown, Baldwin has averaged just 4.3 receptions for 44.8 yards and no touchdowns. We know what he's capable of, but he needs to be downgraded to low-end WR2 territory in this game.  "
15,Tyreek Hill,KC,OAK,8,22,13.7,3.2,"Tyreek has had three busts this season, but it is nothing less than we expected. This is who he is and while it could happen again this week, his upside is too much to leave him out of your starting lineup."
16,Jordy Nelson,GB,NO,5,21,14.4,3.6,"Were Aaron Rodgers healthy, Nelson would be his typical solid WR1 play, as the Saints allow the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. But with Brett Hundley under center, Nelson has to be downgraded. Working in Nelson's favor is that he was generally targeted on shorter routes this year, which should favor targets from the young quarterback. But he'll also likely draw Marshon Lattimore, which could lead Hundley to avoid that matchup as much as possible. For now, consider Nelson a borderline WR1/2, and hope that he and Hundley show a strong connection."
17,Pierre Garcon,SF,DAL,11,21,16.9,2.1,"Garcon continues to be targeted at an astronomical rate, as he has 41 targets over his last four games and 56 on the season, sixth among wide receivers. He continued to see targets from C.J. Beathard last week, so there's no reason to think he'll see much of a drop-off from the quarterback switch. The Dallas secondary is a mess, and the Cowboys have allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Garcon has still not found the end zone, which caps his upside somewhat. But in light of the matchup and the nearly guaranteed volume, Garcon still makes a rock solid WR2 on Sunday."
18,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,WAS,8,29,17.1,4.1,"It seems likely that the Redskins will be down both Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland this week, which should mean big things for Jeffery and the other Philadelphia wide receivers. Jeffery got 10 targets last week, and it seems that Carson Wentz is going to make it a point to get him more involved in the gameplan. If both Norman and Breeland sit, Jeffery should be in line for a big day, and border on being a WR1 in Week 7. If Breeland plays, or especially if Norman does, downgrade Jeffery, but he still should make a low-end WR2."
19,Keenan Allen,LAC,DEN,11,60,19.7,6.5,"Last week, Allen caught 5 balls for 45 yards, which believe it or not, was his worst performance of the season. He's got the questionable tag so be sure to monitor his status. If he suits up, you have to start him even against the Broncos."
20,Rishard Matthews,TEN,CLE,14,35,21.7,3.6,"Matthews has been steady all season, but he isn't getting the type of targets to warrant starting every week. With that said, the Browns are an easy enough matchup that he is a solid WR3 and should be started in almost every league."
21,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,CHI,8,53,21.9,5.6,"Benjamin has found success recently, with 261 yards receiving and a touchdown in his last three games. But he missed practice on Thursday with a knee issue, which is worrisome given his past troubles. If he plays, he'll make a borderline WR2 against a Bears secondary that lacks a standout cornerback, but generally limits No. 1 wide receivers. Monitor Benjamin's practice status for the rest of the week, and be prepared with a backup just in case."
22,T.Y. Hilton,IND,JAC,12,43,22.4,5.2,"I have zero explanation as to what happened with T.Y. Hilton last week against the Titans, as he caught just one pass in one of the best matchups he'll have all year. He also saw just four targets, so maybe it was just the gameplan the Colts employed, though I wouldn't consider that smart. Don't assume that he bounces back this week, either, as he'll play against the best cornerback duo in the NFL. The only wide receivers who've been able to post top-36 numbers against them have been Deandre Hopkins and Antonio Brown, both who saw at least 16 targets in their games. Hilton always has the opportunity to break a long one while on the turf at home, so he's not completely off the radar, but he's just a risky WR3 in this game. "
23,Devin Funchess,CAR,CHI,15,31,22.7,3.0,"Funchess has seen a whopping 36 targets over his past four games, and although he has three touchdown catches, he has failed to top 70 yards in any game. The Chicago defense has done a decent job of limiting opposing wide receivers, though they lack a shutdown corner. Kelvin Benjamin's knee injury flared up on Thursday, and if he's forced to miss this game, Funchess should make a fairly reliable WR2. If Benjamin plays, consider Funchess a borderline WR2/3 who will likely need a touchdown to produce significantly. "
24,Davante Adams,GB,NO,11,39,23.3,3.9,"Adams caught a touchdown pass from Brett Hundley last week, but he clearly needs to be downgraded without Aaron Rodgers. Adams has had a fine season, but needs touchdown catches to make him a truly reliable fantasy wide receiver, and it's simply unclear how effective the Green Bay offense will be right now. The Saints allow the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and will likely put up enough points to force Hundley to need to air it out. Consider Adams a borderline WR2/3, and hope for a touchdown."
25,Amari Cooper,OAK,KC,14,59,26.3,6.3,"The Chiefs have already allowed seven wide receivers total at least 15.5 PPR points against them on the season and a large part of that reason is due to the play of RCB Terrance Mitchell, who will match-up with Cooper this week on roughly 50 percent of his snaps. It's been a rough season for Cooper as well, but we know that one of them is uber-talented. The Raiders designed some shorter routes and confidence boosting passes to Cooper last week, as he caught five of six targets, though they only went for 28 yards. He's is a slump so we can't get too excited, but he should be in lineups as a WR3 with massive upside in this game. "
26,Danny Amendola,NE,ATL,17,37,26.7,4.3,"Amendola is hurt more often than not it seems, but when he is able to play, he is in flex consideration every week. The Patriots' targets don't tend to be consistent but Danny gets targets regardless and should be used against the Falcons this week."
27,DeSean Jackson,TB,BUF,22,37,28.4,3.4,"It's a real bummer for DeSean Jackson owners to go from Jameis Winston to Ryan Fitzpatrick, as one throws a pretty deep ball, while the other doesn't. Even if Winston suits up, it's unlikely that they'll take many shots downfield, limiting Jackson's potential, though this isn't a week where you'd expect two fantasy relevant wide receivers on one team anyways. The Bills have allowed just one wide receiver to finish better than WR22 all season and that was A.J. Green before their bye week. Every wide receiver who's posted a solid game against them this year has been the opposing No. 1 wide receiver, which is obviously Mike Evans.  "
28,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,PHI,21,39,28.5,3.6,"There's no way to trust Pryor at this point, but his owners could hardly ask for a better matchup this weekend against Philadelphia. The Eagles allow the second-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, as both Jalen Mills and Rasul Douglas have struggled. The Redskins are likely going to need points this week, and the way to attack the Eagles is through their secondary, which should mean plenty of targets for Pryor. He was heavily involved in the teams' first meeting, catching six of 11 targets for 66 yards. Although it sounds like Ronald Darby will suit up for this game, it's unclear how effective he will be in his first game back. Pryor is far from a safe option, but should be considered a WR3 here."
29,John Brown,ARI,LAR,23,54,29.8,6.1,"For the first time all season, Brown is off the injury report, as he looks to be finally fully recovered from his quad injury. He's scored in two straight games, and has contributed for fantasy owners in three straight. He destroyed the Rams last year, with 10 catches for 144 yards in the teams' first meeting, and should be in line for another big day here when the teams meet in London. Consider him a borderline WR2. "
30,Nelson Agholor,PHI,WAS,23,53,31.6,5.1,"Agholor has had an incredibly impressive season, scoring four touchdowns and racking up the second-most receiving yards out of the slot position behind only Golden Tate. He had a big game in Week 1 against the Redskins, and there's every reason to think there will be a repeat performance this week. Washington is likely to be down its two top cornerbacks in Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland, so Carson Wentz should have a field day with his receivers. Consider Agholor a WR3 in Monday night's matchup."
31,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,MIA,24,48,34.2,4.7,"Kearse had another strong day with 79 yards receiving against the Patriots. If you are looking for depth, he is a solid addition, but don't spend much in the way of FAAB to acquire him, nor should you rely on him every week."
32,Eric Decker,TEN,CLE,22,53,34.5,5.8,"Decker finally started to put it together last week with 7 receptions for 88 yards. He is in line for a big game again this week against the Browns, and if Delanie Walker is out, you could make a case for Decker being a low-end WR2."
33,Marqise Lee,JAC,IND,14,63,35.5,8.3,"His upside is limited, but if you need a fifth wide receiver who can fill in on bye weeks and during injuries, Lee is the best bet on the waiver wire to pick up 40 to 70 yards with a touchdown here and there. He is clearly Bortles' top target with Robinson out."
34,Cooper Kupp,LAR,ARI,14,53,36.1,6.3,"Kupp has slowed down a bit after a hot start, but he's still consistently involved in the Rams offense. The Cardinals allow the fifth-most points to opposing wide receivers, and their one strength in the secondary - Patrick Peterson - won't be Kupp's problem. Kupp is rarely going to win you a week, but if you're looking for a handful of catches and decent yardage with a decent floor but without much ceiling, Kupp's your guy this week. Consider him a low-end WR3. "
35,Randall Cobb,GB,NO,19,70,37.2,7.1,"Cobb has been quiet for several weeks in a row now, totaling 60 yards or less receiving in each of the past four weeks. The Saints present a good matchup on paper - they allow the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and struggle against slot receivers. But it's anyone's guess how the Green Bay gameplan will unfold with Brett Hundley under center. Cobb rarely scores touchdowns (just one on the season), so to start him would simply be a gamble that Hundley and Cobb show chemistry. That's a risk not worth taking in Week 7."
36,Robert Woods,LAR,ARI,24,64,37.4,8.0,"Woods has quietly been an effective fantasy option most weeks, and his five-catch, 70-yard performance against a tough Jacksonville defense may open some eyes. Jared Goff simply does not target Sammy Watkins often, and Cooper Kupp is still evolving as a receiver. That leaves Woods as perhaps the most reliable option for Goff, and he should continue to see significant targets going forward."
37,Robby Anderson,NYJ,MIA,26,69,40.7,7.7,"Robinson saw 12 targets against the Patriots in Week 6. While adding him isn't sexy, every player seeing this type of target share ought to be owned. Plus, he has the type of speed to break long touchdowns every few weeks."
38,Martavis Bryant,PIT,CIN,26,77,41.2,7.5
39,Ted Ginn,NO,GB,29,64,41.2,7.2,"Ginn had his best game of the season against the Lions, catching all four of his targets for 66 yards and a touchdown. His season has been basically what his owners expected - several dud games with the occasional big day mixed in. It's unclear where things will fall this week against a Packers secondary that has been decimated by injury but which generally limits fantasy production to opposing wide receivers. Ginn is what is he is - a boom or bust borderline WR3 play, that can be started if you need a home run."
40,Allen Hurns,JAC,IND,22,56,42.0,5.9
41,Taylor Gabriel,ATL,NE,25,67,42.4,9.3,"Gabriel saw eight targets on Sunday against Miami, his highest total this season, but came down with just four of them for 39 yards. It was a disappointing effort considering the matchup and the fact that Mohamed Sanu was out. Sanu may be forced to miss at least another game, and next week's matchup against New England should provide tons of opportunities for Gabriel to make plays. As a long-term play, Gabriel probably provides minimal value, but as a bye-week filler for Week 7, he should move to the top of the list."
42,Sterling Shepard,NYG,SEA,25,63,42.2,11.1,"Reports from practice are good this week for Shepard, and it sounds like he has a chance to suit up this weekend against the Seahawks. That's not exactly great news for his fantasy owners, however, as it's a tough matchup and it would be safer to let Shepard rest through the Giants' bye week in Week 8. If he does suit up, it would be difficult to trust him as anything more than a WR4 in light of his injury and the matchup, and he'd make more of a desperation play for this week. "
43,Kenny Stills,MIA,NYJ,27,64,44.3,8.4,"With DeVante Parker banged up, Stills should step into more work. Jay Cutler's presence limits his season-long upside, but from week to week, he has big play potential that could help spurn you to a win."
44,Sammy Watkins,LAR,ARI,29,75,44.2,7.9,"Sammy Watkins had a talk with Sean McVay about getting more targets and that led to just four targets against the Jaguars last week. He's going to struggle again if Patrick Peterson is out there, as Peterson has shut down every receiver he's played against this year. If Peterson plays, Watkins belongs on fantasy benches. If Peterson is misses this game, Watkins needs to be in lineups as a WR3 with upside.  "
45,Jamison Crowder,WAS,PHI,30,61,44.2,8.1,"It's been a lost season for Crowder, who has just 17 receptions for 121 yards on the season. On the surface, it looks like a great matchup for him this weekend against Philadelphia, as the Eagles give up the second-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. But they've been surprisingly effective at limiting opposing slot receivers, as Patrick Robinson is having a career year. Josh Doctson and Terrelle Pryor should have one of their better games of the season, but Crowder can't be started in almost any league."
46,Bennie Fowler,DEN,LAC,30,71,48.1,8.6,"Fowler came off the bye seeing 8 targets in the Bronco's loss to the Giants. Emmanuel Sanders has already been ruled out for Week 7, so Fowler is a strong streamer, but his rest of season appeal is limited."
47,JuJu Smith-Schuster,PIT,CIN,33,67,48.2,6.0,"Smith-Schuster continued his climb toward fantasy relevance, as his modest three-catch, 32-yard performance on Sunday against the Chiefs was actually second on the Steelers in terms of both catches and receiving yardage. There's a great deal of drama around Martavis Bryant, but regardless, Smith-Schuster has cemented himself as the slot receiver at worst, and could have a bigger role if Bryant is traded. Add him as a depth piece who could start in any given week, and hope Bryant moves on."
48,Tyrell Williams,LAC,DEN,29,61,47.9,6.6
49,Ricardo Louis,CLE,TEN,37,69,48.5,6.5,"Louis is involved in the Browns' passing attack, but he is a WR5 at the very most for the rest of the season. With that being said, if you need a one week streamer, he has a solid matchup against the Titans this weekend."
50,Mohamed Sanu,ATL,NE,27,98,48.7,12.7,"It appears that Sanu will play on Sunday, and that's good news for fantasy owners, as the Patriots are one of the worst teams in the league against opposing wide receivers. Sanu had seen 24 targets in his first four games, which includes the game against Buffalo when he left early, so it's obvious he'll be more involved this season than last. Consider him a very low-end WR3 here, but one with potential."
51,Mike Wallace,BAL,MIN,37,72,50.3,6.8
52,Jordan Matthews,BUF,TB,31,86,52.7,13.3
53,Tyler Lockett,SEA,NYG,32,102,54.1,9.9,"Lockett just hasn't been able to get going despite looking healthier in recent weeks, as the Seattle offense is simply sputtering along without much explosiveness. He should see Janoris Jenkins at least some of the time on Sunday against the Giants, and that's a very tough matchup, though he may be able to find some room against Eli Apple. The Giants generally hold wide receivers in check (they allow the ninth-fewest fantasy points to the position), so consider Lockett no more than a WR4."
54,Josh Doctson,WAS,PHI,29,82,55.1,9.6,"Doctson has just nine targets and four receptions on the year, but two of his four catches have gone for touchdowns. He has immense talent, but he's far from reliable given his limited involvement in the offense. Absent extremely deep leagues, fantasy owners can't possibly start Doctson right now, but his enormous potential makes him a great bench-piece add, especially for owners who look to be well on their way toward making the playoffs."
55,Kendall Wright,CHI,CAR,31,74,54.5,6.5,"It's hard for any receiver to do much when his quarterback throws only 16 times, but Wright at least chipped in with three catches for 36 yards last week against the Ravens. It's clear that the Chicago gameplan is to limit Mitchell Trubisky's throws, which puts a cap on Wright's already limited value. The Panthers are decent against opposing wide receivers, but regardless of the matchup, fantasy owners simply can't rely on Wright right now. Consider him a WR5, and avoid him absent dire circumstances."
56,Paul Richardson,SEA,NYG,40,80,55.6,6.1,"Richardson, like all he Seattle wide receivers, hasn't shown much this season, as his only fantasy-relevant weeks have come when he's found the end zone. That makes him a tough start on Sunday against the Giants, who allow the ninth-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. Richardson will see Janoris Jenkins on at least some of his routes, and that's a tough task for any wide receiver. Consider him a WR4/5, and only a desperation play."
57,Cole Beasley,DAL,SF,36,93,58.1,8.2
58,Adam Humphries,TB,BUF,29,65,57.5,6.6,"Humphries just continues to produce, with at least 51 yards in four straight games. He'll rarely find the end zone, as he has just three career touchdown catches, but he should provide a fairly high weekly floor for a receiver that is widely available. Particularly in PPR formats, Humphries is nearing must-add status, but should be added in deep standard leagues, too."
59,Devante Parker,MIA,NYJ,29,126,56.8,24.0,"Parker didn't play last week with his ankle injury, and while he should go this weekend, be sure to monitor his status just in case something changes. If he plays, he should be started even though he has been a disappointment this season."
