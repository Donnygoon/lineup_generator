Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,CIN,1,6,1.4,0.9,"Bell is officially back to getting insane usage with at least 25 touches in three straight weeks. Expect more of the same this week, so although Cincy's run defense isn't bad, he is the clear top running back this week again."
2,Kareem Hunt,KC,OAK,1,6,2.6,1.2,"Kareem Hunt hasn't scored a touchdown in three weeks now and only had 21 rushing yards last week, but he has still gone for over 100 total yards every single game this season. He should have no trouble continuing the trend and getting back in the end zone this week."
3,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,SF,1,43,4.7,6.4,"Elliott's tumultuous season took another turn this week, as he was granted a temporary restraining order that will allow him to play in Week 7 against San Francisco. That's great news for Elliott's fantasy owners, both because they don't need an immediate replacement and because the 49ers allow the second-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. Elliott hasn't had a great season, averaging just 3.7 yards per carry and scoring only two touchdowns. But he should feast in a soft matchup on Sunday, and makes an easy top-five option."
4,Todd Gurley,LAR,ARI,2,14,5.0,2.1,"Gurley has slowed down a bit since he hit the tough part of his schedule, but 170 total yards over the last two weeks is hardly crushing fantasy owners. The Cardinals are tough on opposing running backs, allowing the seventh-fewest fantasy points to the position and giving up less than 3.3 yards per carry. But Gurley's involvement in the passing game almost guarantees production in any matchup, and he should be considered an RB1 here, as he usually is."
5,LeSean McCoy,BUF,TB,1,12,5.4,2.1,"McCoy isn't great anymore and you may want to lump him in the same tier as Demarco Murray because McCoy hasn't gotten in the end zone, but he is getting right around 20 touches every game and should once again this week so he is still an RB1."
6,Devonta Freeman,ATL,NE,2,14,6.1,2.4,"Freeman has had his usual solid season, and that should continue on Sunday night against the Patriots, who have allowed the third-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. It's a road game, which, for some reason, usually limits Freeman a bit, but there's little reason to worry. In a likely shootout, Freeman should get plenty of work, and will likely be more heavily involved in the passing game, as the Patriots particularly struggle to contain pass-catching backs. Consider Freeman an RB1 here and start him with confidence. "
7,Melvin Gordon,LAC,DEN,4,11,7.1,1.8,"Gordon has 15 receptions in the past two games. Oh, and 45 carries. He is an RB1 every single week even in a matchup against a defense like the Broncos. Expect another 20 to 30 touches this week and a touchdown or two."
8,Mark Ingram,NO,GB,2,18,8.1,2.3,"It was the week Mark Ingram owners were waiting for when the running back totaled a season-high 30 touches for 150 yards and two touchdowns against the Lions. He also played a season-high 66 percent of the snaps with Adrian Peterson off to the Cardinals. Your opportunity to buy him at a discount has officially been slam shut. The Packers had been decent against the run this year despite missing DT Mike Daniels for a few weeks and playing against Devonta Freeman, Joe Mixon, Jordan Howard, and Ezekiel Elliott, while allowing just 97.4 fantasy points in the first five games to running backs. Now part of that success came from the fact that their opponents were only averaging 62 plays per game with Aaron Rodgers holding down sustained drives. They won't have that opportunity anymore, so don't be shy about starting Ingram as a strong RB2 in this game.  "
9,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,CHI,6,18,11.2,3.2,"McCaffrey has done almost nothing on the ground this season, averaging just 2.7 yards per carry, but he's now scored a receiving touchdown in back to back games. His high volume of targets always keeps him in the RB2 range, and that's especially true against a Bears team that gives up an average of five catchers per game to opposing running backs. Consider McCaffrey his usual low-end RB2 here, and hope for another touchdown."
10,Jay Ajayi,MIA,NYJ,4,20,12.0,3.8,"Ajayi is one of the true bell cow running backs in the NFL and finally had a big week last week. You may be discouraged because he hasn't gotten into the end zone, but that will come and it could come in bunches when it does."
11,Jerick McKinnon,MIN,BAL,8,25,12.4,3.0,"McKinnon has been fantastic over the last two weeks, averaging 21 touches per game and scoring three touchdowns. He'll now get a tough matchup against a Ravens rush defense that should get Brandon Williams back. The Ravens excel against pass-catching backs, allowing the third-fewest receptions to the position, and that's usually where McKinnon gets a ton of added value. His volume leaves him as an RB2 here, but his production may dwindle a bit this week."
12,Carlos Hyde,SF,DAL,6,23,12.6,2.6,"Although he was rumored to be on the trading block and on the verge of losing snaps to Matt Breida, Hyde had one of his most productive fantasy games of the season on Sunday against the Redskins, scoring two touchdowns. It wasn't a great effort overall, as he averaged just 2.2 yards per carry, but he was on the field for 78 percent of the snaps, showing that he is still the back to own in San Francisco. The Cowboys allow the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, so Hyde should have a big day here, as the 49ers will likely look to the running game to ease the pressure off C.J. Beathard. Consider him a borderline RB1 on Sunday."
13,Alvin Kamara,NO,GB,8,28,13.9,3.9,"Kamara had a solid, but not huge game last week against the Lions, but he did see 10 carries and gained 75 yards rushing, both season-highs. There's no doubting his talent, so if he sees double-digit touches going forward, as he should, he'll be in the RB2 discussion each week. That's the case this week against the Packers, despite the fact that they've allowed relatively few fantasy points to running backs. Without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers won't be able to sustain drives or be play from way ahead, and both Kamara and Mark Ingram should get in plenty of work. Consider Kamara an RB2 with upside."
14,Jordan Howard,CHI,CAR,5,20,14.0,3.6,"Howard received an astounding 36 carries last week against the Ravens, turning them into 167 yards. He's obviously not going to see that workload again this weekend against Carolina, but he's received no fewer than 18 carries in any game over the last four weeks, and has three touchdowns over that span. The Panthers stop the run well, but Luke Kuechly may not play after sustaining a concussion last week. If he's forced to miss the game, Howard is a mid-tier RB1, but he's no worse than a low-end RB1 even if Kuechly suits up."
15,Chris Thompson,WAS,PHI,9,22,15.4,3.3,"This is a matchup that favors Thompson, as the Eagles have already allowed three running backs to accumulate 52 or more receiving yards, including Thompson himself in their Week 1 meeting. If the Eagles don't have trouble moving the ball on the Redskins depleted defense (which they shouldn't), the Redskins aren't going to have much of an option to run the ball. Over the last two weeks, the Eagles defense has allowed 18 yards on 26 carries. Yes, you read that right. Thompson is a high-end RB3 who has RB2 appeal in PPR leagues. "
16,C.J. Anderson,DEN,LAC,8,26,17.9,3.3,"After having success while handing the ball off to C.J. Anderson 20 or more times in three different games, they decided to give him just nine carries against the Giants. It was actually the first game of the season where he averaged less than four yards per carry, as well as the first game he didn't catch at least one pass. Consider it a glitch in the matrix, because the Broncos will go back to Anderson when they head to Los Angeles. The Chargers have now allowed 152.5 rushing yards per game to opponents, including a rushing touchdown in each of the last four games. Anderson ran for 81 yards in their first meeting, but the Chargers have seemingly gotten worse since then. Consider Anderson a high-end RB2 for this game that could wind up as a top-five play this week.  "
17,Doug Martin,TB,BUF,10,32,18.5,3.9,"Martin remained involved last week despite Arizona getting out to a big lead, as he got 15 touches and scored a touchdown. It's clear that Tampa Bay won't get away from Martin as the workhorse back regardless of the circumstances, which portends good things going forward. The Bills are a tough matchup - they allow the eighth-fewest fantasy points to opposing running backs - but Martin's volume is always going to make him a play. Consider him a high-end RB2 in the tough matchup, and look for him to get the goal-line work, as usual. "
18,Adrian Peterson,ARI,LAR,7,29,19.2,4.4,"Peterson's debut with the Cardinals went better than even the most optimistic fan could have hoped for, as he ran for 134 yards and two touchdowns on 26 carries against the Bucs. While he almost certainly won't have quite that level of success again this week against the Rams, another solid effort looks to be in the cards. The Rams are allowing the most fantasy points to opposing running backs, and the Arizona passing game clearly benefitted from having an established ground game. Look for Peterson to be a solid RB2 here, and potentially score a touchdown or two."
19,Duke Johnson,CLE,TEN,10,29,19.3,3.7,"The Texans shut Duke down last week, but prior to that performance, he had four games for 21 receptions and 250 yards, plus all the rushing work, so he should still be regarded as a solid flex every week."
20,Tevin Coleman,ATL,NE,13,31,21.3,3.1,"Coleman has been decent this year for fantasy purposes, but the entire Atlanta offense has been somewhat underwhelming. That should change this weekend against the Patriots, particularly for Coleman. The Patriots allow the third-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, and particularly struggle against pass-catching backs, allowing the most receiving yards and second-most receptions to the position. Coleman has 14 receptions on the season, and should be able to do some damage in the passing game. He makes a low-end RB2 here, with upside."
21,James White,NE,ATL,11,29,22.3,3.6
22,Joe Mixon,CIN,PIT,12,38,23.4,4.8,"Mixon isn't getting enough love this week. He is coming off the bye and going against one of the worst run defenses. Add in a seemingly guarunteed 15 to 20 touches and you've got to play him, no questions asked."
23,DeMarco Murray,TEN,CLE,11,40,23.5,6.6,"There is some danger in playing Murray, as he has a strained hammy and the Titans likely wouldn't need him against the Browns. He could end up with a huge game if they trust him with 12+ touches, however, so consider him a boom or bust this week. "
24,Javorius Allen,BAL,MIN,18,36,23.5,3.7,"It was supposed to be a week that we could trust Javorius Allen. It was the second time that we'd felt that way, with the other being the game against the Jaguars in London. In those two games combined, Allen has combined for 18 carries, eight receptions, and 94 scoreless yards. You will never feel comfortable putting him into your lineup, though it would help if Terrance West is ruled out again. The Vikings have yet to allow an opposing team to run for more than 3.6 yards per carry, so it's not going to make much of a difference how many carries Allen gets this week. The Vikings have allowed just one receiving touchdown to a running back and it came on a fake punt to Benny Cunningham in Week 5. Outside of that, they've allowed just 26 receiving yards to running backs over the last three weeks. Allen is nothing more than a RB3 this week, who gets a slight boost if LB Anthony Barr is forced to miss this game."
25,Chris Ivory,JAC,IND,7,48,23.6,11.7,"Fournette is expected to play Sunday after injuring his ankle in the Jaguars comeback attempt. There is, of course, a chance that he is scratched and you've all of a sudden got a 20+ touch running back on your hands. Even if not, Ivory had 9 receptions last week and could continue to see that type of work in the desperate Jags' passing game."
26,Derrick Henry,TEN,CLE,10,47,28.3,7.1,"Henry was great in garbage time for the second time this season, but after the game, their coach told us they plan on a split backfield the remainder of the season. With that said, this is a great game script and Murray has a strained hammy so he seems to be a solid start for Week 7."
27,Ty Montgomery,GB,NO,19,38,28.4,4.4,"The Packers got Ty Montgomery back in Week 6, but it didn't help matters for fantasy owners. Now staring at a potentially bottom-10 scoring offense without Rodgers, Montgomery has lost a lot of his appeal. The Saints have held three of the last four teams they've played to 3.7 or less yards per carry and haven't allowed a team of running backs more than 97 yards since back in Week 1 when Dalvin Cook tagged them for 127 yards himself. In fact, if you were to go back to 2016, the Saints have surprisingly only allowed two running backs to run for more than 85 yards against them (Cook, Devonta Freeman 2x). The snaps in Week 6 favored Aaron Jones (43 to 20), but that was likely due to Montgomery being eased back in. Still, you cannot trust Montgomery as anything more than an RB3 right now. "
28,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,WAS,18,36,28.7,3.3,"LeGarrette Blount has run the ball a lot better the last few weeks, totaling 344 yards on his last 58 carries (5.93 YPC), which has all come after he didn't receive a single carry in Week 2. He's only scored one touchdown in that time, limiting his upside, but Carson Wentz isn't going to throwing over two touchdowns per game. Blount totaled 46 yards on 14 carries in their first meeting and scored, though it was a receiving touchdown. The stars align here, though, as they are a home favorite with an offense that should score points against a banged-up defense. Blount is most definitely on the RB2 radar in standard leagues, though he's not quite as appealing in PPR formats. "
29,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,KC,22,40,29.3,3.0,"It's gotten to the point where Marshawn Lynch just doesn't play on a team good enough to grind him out in wins, leaving him to touch the ball a maximum of 13 times over the last five weeks. He's coming off a matchup against the Chargers who may just be the worst run defense in the league, yet he walked away with just 63 yards. Lynch isn't done, but he's also not getting enough work to trust on a weekly basis.  Prior to Le'Veon Bell killing them last week, the Chiefs hadn't allowed a running back to total more than 79 yards on the ground. "
30,Orleans Darkwa,NYG,SEA,20,48,29.7,4.7,"Darkwa was shockingly effective against the Broncos, gaining 117 yards on 21 carries and adding a reception for 13 yards. He clearly established himself as the running back to own for the Giants, as Wayne Gallman was largely held in check. Darkwa is averaging 5.7 yards per carry, and has a good chance to see 15-20 touches per game if he remains healthy. He's a must-add in what was thought to be a hopeless situation."
31,Frank Gore,IND,JAC,14,41,31.7,5.1,"Gore has limited upside even against a Jaguars' run defense who has struggled again the run this season. You can rely on 5 to 8 points, but there are over 30 better options this week so hopefully you can find one."
32,Tarik Cohen,CHI,CAR,25,43,32.0,3.1,"Cohen saw 15 touches last week after seeing just 17 over the previous two games, but he gained only 46 total yards. With Benny Cunningham eating into Cohen's work, and the speedy back no longer running as effectively, it would be difficult to trust him this week against a tough Carolina run defense, even if Luke Kuechly misses the game. Consider him an RB4, at best."
33,Aaron Jones,GB,NO,23,60,32.6,6.0,"It's anyone's guess how the Green Bay backfield will break down, particularly in light of the injury to Aaron Rodgers. The Saints allow the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, but they are much more vulnerable to pass-catching backs, which suggests that Ty Montgomery may have more success than Jones this week. On the other hand, the Packers surely want to establish a ground game to ease the burden on Brett Hundley, so Jones should still see a fairly healthy dose of carries. In the end, Jones is a risky Flex play, unless we get more definitive word as to how Mike McCarthy plans to attack the Saints."
34,Leonard Fournette,JAC,IND,2,52,12.9,14.1,"Fournette missed practice again Friday so be sure to monitor his status. As for now, he is expected to play and would be a must-start obviously, but if he misses, Chris Ivory would become a low-end RB2 so make sure to add him now just in case before someone else does."
35,Matt Forte,NYJ,MIA,16,69,34.9,6.7,"You may not have noticed because there wasn't much in the way of production, but the Jets gave Forte a whopping 17 touches this week with Powell out. He isn't a start at this point, but he is worth adding because if we see it again, you can plug him into your flex most weeks."
36,Dion Lewis,NE,ATL,22,55,35.7,5.1,"If anyone could know what Belichek was going to do or who he would use from week to week, they would be paid millions by an NFL team. We can't know if this was a one week volume share for Lewis (because of Gillislee's fumble) or if it will continue all season. Lewis is worth the speculative add, but don't splurge your FAAB for him."
37,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,TEN,25,48,35.9,4.4
38,Marlon Mack,IND,JAC,22,49,37.6,4.5,"Robert Turbin is out now, so his 30% snap share and 5 targets from last game should transfer to Mack who has big play potential. Plus, the Jags give up more than their share of big plays."
39,Bilal Powell,NYJ,MIA,21,52,38.5,5.4
40,Andre Ellington,ARI,LAR,25,89,36.8,11.4,"After catching 18 passes over his previous two games, Ellington gave his fantasy owners a goose egg in Week 6 against the Bucs, as the Cardinals jumped out to a big lead and rode Adrian Peterson. It's clear with Peterson in the fold that Ellington's production is going to be game-script dependent - when the Cardinals are trailing, they'll use Ellington in the passing game, and when they're ahead, they won't. Unfortunately, this week's matchup against the Rams sets up better for Peterson, as the Cardinals are not projected to trail much, if any. The Rams give up the most fantasy points to opposing running backs, but that shouldn't matter much if Ellington doesn't get the work, and since Ellington is battling a knee injury, he may not have a big role regardless. Consider him an RB4 here."
41,Alex Collins,BAL,MIN,30,54,41.6,4.0,"The Ravens have been giving the ball to Collins enough so that he has more yards per game over his last 5 than DeMarco Murray, Melvin Gordon, LeSean McCoy and Lamar Miller. The fact is, they haven't even let him loose because of fumble concerns, so there is enough potential her for him to end up a high-end RB2."
42,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,CHI,29,56,41.9,4.7,"If you're starting Stewart this week, it's purely in the hope that he scores his first rushing touchdown against a Bears team that has allowed five rushing touchdowns to running backs. The Bears make a decent matchup for opposing rushers, as they've seen an increase in their YPC allowed in each of the first six weeks. But Stewart has totaled 17 yards on 26 carries over the last two weeks (you read that right), so it's impossible to start him with any confidence. He's a borderline RB3 in light of the matchup, but you likely have better options."
43,Mike Gillislee,NE,ATL,33,65,45.1,5.9
44,Giovani Bernard,CIN,PIT,28,56,45.6,6.1
45,Wendell Smallwood,PHI,WAS,25,63,46.8,8.4,"Smallwood looks to be in line to play on Monday against the Redskins after missing two games with a knee injury, and immediately warrants at least some fantasy attention. In the only game Smallwood played without Darren Sproles, he scored a touchdown and caught four passes for 45 yards. The Redskins generally struggle against pass-catching backs, so Smallwood should likely be able to do enough damage through the air to be in the Flex conversation."
46,Wayne Gallman,NYG,SEA,38,61,46.0,5.7
47,Latavius Murray,MIN,BAL,38,68,45.9,4.3,"Murray has averaged 15 touches per game over the last two weeks, but he's obviously taken a back seat to Jerick Mckinnon. The Ravens are tough on opposing running backs, and should get Brandon Williams back for this game. If you start Murray, you're essentially hoping for a touchdown, and that's a tough gamble to take. Consider him an RB4 without a ton of upside."
48,Samaje Perine,WAS,PHI,35,71,49.3,8.2
49,Jamaal Charles,DEN,LAC,24,59,48.1,5.6,"Jamaal Charles has seen his carries decline every week this season, as he's touched the ball just six times in each of the last two games. The return of Devontae Booker has had more of an effect than most would have thought. Charles can't be played as anything more than a big-play-dependent RB5 in fantasy leagues. "
50,Thomas Rawls,SEA,NYG,35,62,48.1,4.3,"Rawls did nothing to run away with the Seattle running back job in Week 5 against the Rams, as he gained just 20 yards on eight carries and 15 yards on two catches. But he out-snapped Eddie Lacy 32 to 19, and Lacy was ineffective. Pete Carroll continues to suggest that Rawls and Lacy will split time, but of the two, Rawls has the better opportunity to take the job in light of his performance last year. Add Rawls, but don't expect to start him for at least a week or two."
51,Shane Vereen,NYG,SEA,32,60,48.7,5.5
52,Robert Kelley,WAS,PHI,34,71,51.0,8.0,"Kelley looks like he'll return from an ankle injury this week, just in time to take on a very difficult Philadelphia defense that allows just 3.8 yards per carry. Kelley's gotten a bit of a bad rap this season, as he's averaging 4.5 yards per carry on 29 attempts. Chris Thompson is the lead dog in the Redskins backfield right now, but Kelley makes a desperation Flex play, now that it appears likely he'll be out there on Monday night."
53,C.J. Prosise,SEA,NYG,23,84,50.7,8.9
54,Charles Sims,TB,BUF,35,61,49.5,4.8
55,Matt Breida,SF,DAL,39,61,51.2,5.1
56,Darren McFadden,DAL,SF,34,81,58.2,12.8,"McFadden has been inactive for every game this season, but instantly became relevant when Ezekiel Elliott's suspension went back into effect. It's unclear whether Alfred Morris or McFadden will get the bulk of the carries while Elliott is out, and it's possible that the Cowboys were simply trying to limit the wear and tear on McFadden's body in the event he was needed for more significant work. The best bet is that it's largely a timeshare between Morris and McFadden, which should make both running backs potential Flex plays. Until fantasy owners know exactly how the situation will play out, they should add McFadden immediately, even if they keep him on the bench for a few weeks while the situation sorts itself out."
57,Corey Grant,JAC,IND,33,82,66.5,14.8
58,Eddie Lacy,SEA,NYG,35,67,54.7,5.6,"There's not much to like about Lacy right now, as he's seeing limited snaps, splitting work with Thomas Rawls, and playing behind a terrible offensive line. The Giants aren't great at stopping the run, but there's no matchup that should make you feel comfortable starting Lacy. He likely needs a touchdown to have any value, and the Giants have allowed only two rushing touchdowns all year. Absent an incredibly deep league, you shouldn't go anywhere near Lacy this week. "
