Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Rob Gronkowski,NE,ATL,1,5,1.4,0.9,"Atlanta gives up a load of passing yards and touchdowns, but believe it or not, they have been quite good against tight ends. That isn't to say Gronk isn't a clear start, but he might not be a top two play this week for once."
2,Zach Ertz,PHI,WAS,1,4,2.0,0.7,"There aren't enough superlatives to adequately describe Ertz's performance this year, as he's on pace to shatter his career-bests in every statistical category. He's a top-three play in any matchup, and particularly in Monday's game against the Redskins, who allow the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. He's a top-two option."
3,Travis Kelce,KC,OAK,2,8,3.5,1.0,"Oakland is quite a bit better against tight ends this season, but Kelce is still a clear-cut top 4 tight end this week. Kansas City should continue to give him the team lead in targets against the Raiders."
4,Jimmy Graham,SEA,NYG,2,49,5.2,6.3,"This is about as good a situation for Graham as there can be, as the Giants allow the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends and have allowed a touchdown to a tight end in every game this year. Graham has been a significant piece of the Seattle offense in recent weeks, seeing 25 targets and catching 17 passes over his last three games. Graham makes one of the top options at tight end this week, and there's little reason to have any doubt in his performance."
5,Delanie Walker,TEN,CLE,2,16,6.4,2.9,"Oddly enough, Delanie Walker has still yet to score a receiving touchdown this year (he has a rushing touchdown), while his teammates at tight end have three of them. That should get righted this week against the Browns who have already allowed four top-10 performances to tight ends, including a 68-yard, two-touchdown performance to Tyler Kroft a few weeks back. Walker is a must-start elite TE1 play who can be used in tournament and cash-game lineups.  "
6,Austin Seferian-Jenkins,NYJ,MIA,2,9,6.5,1.5,ASJ has looked excellent and is seeing enough work to support two fantasy tight ends. This week's matchup against the Dolphins is about as good as it gets too so make sure to start him if you've got the opportunity.
7,Evan Engram,NYG,SEA,3,12,6.5,1.9,"Engram has shattered the myth that rookie tight ends can't produce in fantasy, as he's on pace for perhaps the best season by a rookie tight end in NFL history. The matchup against Seattle isn't great, but it isn't quite that daunting, as the Seahawks are middle of the road against opposing tight ends. Either way, Engram should get enough volume to make him a fine option here in light of the Giants' troubles at receiver, and is firmly in the TE1 conversation, as he always is."
8,Hunter Henry,LAC,DEN,4,14,8.0,2.2,"Henry has two busts on the year, but those days are over, as he has finally passed the threshold from being a borderline weekly streamer to an every week must play. He is playing near every snap and has a solid matchup this week too."
9,Cameron Brate,TB,BUF,5,16,9.8,2.4,"Brate has now scored in four straight games, and has seen 23 targets over his previous three contests. The Bills allow the eighth-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends, but Brate succeeded in a tough matchup against Arizona last week, so it's tough to doubt him. Buffalo has yet to allow a touchdown to an opposing tight end, however, which has to factor into Brate's outlook. He remains a TE1, but perhaps ranks a little lower than he usually would."
10,Jordan Reed,WAS,PHI,2,17,9.8,2.5,"Reed has battled injuries all year, but unlike previous seasons, he has not been able to overcome them to be effective. He hasn't had more than 48 yards receiving in any game this season, and has been significantly outpaced by backup tight end Vernon Davis. The Eagles aren't particularly imposing against tight ends, but they have a real weakness with their cornerbacks, and Kirk Cousins is likely to attack them with the Redskins' wide receivers, rather than Reed. Given the state of the position, Reed is still a borderline start here, but don't expect much production."
11,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,BAL,5,15,10.6,2.5,"Kyle Rudolph has now seen nine targets in back-to-back games, which is not coincidental that it's when Diggs has missed time. Similar to last year, when Diggs was either out or not full healthy, Rudolph saw massive target totals. Opposing tight ends haven't seen many targets against the Ravens, but of the ones they have, they've done a lot of damage. On 30 targets to tight ends, the Ravens have allowed 21/262/6, which amounts to a 136.4 QB Rating. Rudolph is back into the must-start TE1 conversation, especially while Diggs is out or limited.  "
12,George Kittle,SF,DAL,10,19,12.8,1.7,"Kittle was heavily involved in the 49ers offense once again, seeing eight targets against Washington after seeing nine against Indianapolis the previous week. The tight end position is a wasteland after the top few option, so Kittle's sudden uptick in targets makes him a definite add off the waiver wire. There's no reason to spend a top waiver claim or significant FAAB dollars, but Kittle makes a strong add for owners struggling at the position."
13,Jason Witten,DAL,SF,7,47,13.9,5.4,"It's sad to see Jason Witten fall down the fantasy leaderboards over the last few weeks, because if you recall, he was the No. 1 fantasy tight end after two weeks and it wasn't all that close. But now, over his last three games combined, he's totaled just 10 catches for 73 scoreless yards. The 49ers aren't likely to bust him out of his slump, either, as they have not allowed a single tight end to finish better than the TE20 in any of their six games. Keep in mind that they've played against Jordan Reed, Jimmy Graham, and Greg Olsen. Witten is off the TE1 radar and belongs on fantasy benches.  "
14,Austin Hooper,ATL,NE,7,19,13.8,2.7,"We knew that when Mohamed Sanu went down that Austin Hooper would see increased targets, but we did not know that he'd see 16 of them in two games. He's turned them into 12 catches for 98 yards, though he's yet to score a touchdown since the Week 1 game against the Bears. That should change against the Patriots who have now allowed a touchdown to the tight end position in five of their six games. Ed Dickson was the only one who failed to find the end zone. Hooper can be in line for a true breakout game with all the attention that will be placed on Julio Jones. Consider Hooper a rock-solid TE1 in this contest. "
15,Jack Doyle,IND,JAC,9,23,14.2,2.8
16,Benjamin Watson,BAL,MIN,9,23,17.1,3.1
17,Zach Miller,CHI,CAR,11,24,17.4,2.7,"After seeing seven targets against Minnesota in Mitchell Trubisky's first game, Miller saw just three targets on Sunday against Baltimore. One of those targets, however, was a touchdown pass from running back Tarik Cohen. The fact that most of Miller's production came from a pass from a running back isn't encouraging, but this is two consecutive games with a touchdown, and that's more than fantasy owners can say for most tight ends. Miller isn't an exciting add, but for owners struggling at the tight end position, he can provide value as a streamer."
18,Tyler Kroft,CIN,PIT,13,26,18.8,2.6
19,Jared Cook,OAK,KC,15,23,18.7,2.0,"Some wondered (myself included) how the Chiefs would defend the tight end position once Eric Berry went down, but they've responded well, failing to allow any tight end to finish inside the top-10 in any week. Keep in mind that they played against Zach Ertz and the combination of Hunter Henry/Antonio Gates. Jared Cook has totaled just 39 yards over the last two weeks and should be left on fantasy benches against the Chiefs.  "
20,Ed Dickson,CAR,CHI,8,32,19.5,3.3,"Dickson came down to earth after his huge performance against the Lions in Week 5, but he did get eight targets last week against the Eagles, suggesting that he'll remain an integral part of the offense. The Bears have been solid against opposing tight ends (if you take away Austin Hooper's monstrous performance in Week 1), so it's unlikely that Dickson has a huge game here. But with 17 targets over his past three games, Dickson should give you a fairly decent floor, though he still falls outside of the TE1 range."
21,Nick O'Leary,BUF,TB,10,30,20.0,4.0,"O'Leary looked solid filling in for Charles Clay in Week 5, and may have to be involved in the passing attack while he is out, but there has to be a handful of better streaming tight ends every week, so there is no use in owning him unless we see more."
22,Martellus Bennett,GB,NO,15,28,20.3,2.8,"Bennett has had a terrible season, never exceeding 53 yards receiving in any game and failing to find the end zone. He now loses Aaron Rodgers and instead gains Brett Hundley, which is unlikely to help his production. The Saints are tough on tight ends, but absent the juiciest matchup of all time, you can't start Bennett at this point anyway. If you do own him in a deep league, there's probably still a better option on the waiver wire for this week."
23,Vernon Davis,WAS,PHI,17,34,23.6,2.9

28,Gerald Everett,LAR,ARI,18,46,30.4,5.3
29,Coby Fleener,NO,GB,19,34,26.8,2.9,"After totaling 54 yards and a touchdown in Week 1, Coby Fleener has fallen off the face of the earth. Okay, maybe that's a bit much. But seriously, he's totaled just 10 targets over their last four games, turning them into six catches for 75 yards and one touchdown. After looking at the box score this week, you could have missed him, as he had just one target and no production. With Snead's role growing, it's hard to see this changing. On top of that, the Packers have not allowed a single top-12 tight end performance against them this year.  "

33,Jermaine Gresham,ARI,LAR,25,39,31.4,2.7
34,Marcedes Lewis,JAC,IND,22,41,32.5,4.3,"Outside of Marcedes Lewis' one game against the Ravens in London where he totaled 62 yards and three touchdowns, he's totaled exactly one catch for 14 yards in the other five games combined. He's not involved in the offense right now which is kind of a letdown because the Colts have allowed a tight end touchdown in three of their last four games. Still, you aren't going to play Lewis in any season-long league. "
