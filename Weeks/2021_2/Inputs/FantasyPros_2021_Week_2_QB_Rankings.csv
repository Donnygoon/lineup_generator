The Raiders' offensive line could be a major problem. Rookie right tackle Alex Leatherwood and center Andre James visibly struggled against Baltimore, and now the Raiders head east to deal with a Pittsburgh defense that had an NFL-high 56 sacks last season. Carr finished with a bang on Monday night and rewarded the fantasy managers who played him with 435 passing yards and a pair of touchdowns.

That shouldn't be a disaster for Washington: Heinicke is considered one of the better backups in the league. He isn't quite the swashbuckler Fitzpatrick is, so Terry McLaurin investors might be mildly disappointed. But Heinicke is likely to have fewer multiple-interception games than Fitz would have. Washington went fairly conservative after Fitzpatrick went down in the second quarter, with Heinicke completing 11 of 15 throws for 122 yards, with one touchdown (to Logan Thomas) and no interceptions. That's understandable, with Heinicke having had few reps in the week leading up to the game, and with RB Antonio Gibson capable of doing the heavy lifting for the Washington offense.
