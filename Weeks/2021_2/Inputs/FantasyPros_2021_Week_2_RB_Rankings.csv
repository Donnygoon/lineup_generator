It was expected that Raheem Mostert and Sermon would divide most of the carries in a potent and alluring backfield. Mostert was indeed a prominent part of the picture in Week 1 - until he sustained a knee injury that wound up being season-ending. But Sermon was a healthy scratch, and instead of the third-rounder from Ohio State, it was another rookie, sixth-rounder Elijah Mitchell of Louisiana-Lafayette, who made noise. Mitchell played 35 of 55 snaps and carried 19 times for 104 yards and a touchdown (though he didn't see a target). JaMycal Hasty played 16 snaps, with his only carry being a three-yard TD run. He also had a 15-yard catch. The debate in fantasy this week has been whether Mitchell is worth the huge waiver expenditure it took to get him in FAAB leagues this week. A lot of fantasy managers believe Sermon is still the guy you want to have in this backfield. I touted Sermon throughout the offseason because I've seen the Shanahan family's zone-blocking scheme turn jobbers like Tatum Bell and Reuben Droughns into one-year wonders, while elite talents like Terrell Davis and Clinton Portis produced legendary seasons in it. If Sermon is an elite talent - and he sure looked the part at OSU last year - he could be an RB1 at a committee-back price. That could still be the case. But as a golfer, I also believe in playing the ball as it lies. For whatever reason, Shanahan used Mitchell over Sermon in Week 1, and then Mitchell proceeded to have a good game. It seems counterintuitive that Sermon would vault past Mitchell in Week 2. Sermon is an errant drive into the rough, and I'm not going to deceive myself about the reality of the situation by fluffing up a bad lie. I have Mitchell ranked RB23 this week and RB22 in the rest-of-season rankings. Sermon is RB48 this week and RB40 rest of season. Hasty is unplayable for now, but with all the Shanahanagans going on in this backfield, who knows? He could be the hot waiver add next week.",,,RB25,C+,12.8,2.0140071428571424

Williams played 51% of the offensive snaps on Monday, Murray played 31%, and the Ravens promoted Freeman to the active roster Thursday. Williams looked like he had more juice than Murray. Williams had a nice 21-yard gain on a catch in the flat early on. He exploded through the middle on a 35-yard TD run. Murray had a touchdown too, but Williams averaged 7.2 yards per carry, Murray averaged 2.8. On the other hand, Williams whiffed badly on a couple of blocks. The second whiff led to a sack and a fumble, giving the Raiders the ball for what turned out to be the game-winning drive. No doubt John Harbaugh was disappointed with Williams' effort on those plays. As of now I have Williams ranked RB25, Murray RB49, and I still haven't decided where I'm going to slot Freeman. I'll be trying to read the tea leaves on this backfield all the way up to kickoff on Sunday.",,,RB43,D,7.0,1.0814225806451612

It was expected that Raheem Mostert and Sermon would divide most of the carries in a potent and alluring backfield. Mostert was indeed a prominent part of the picture in Week 1 - until he sustained a knee injury that wound up being season-ending. But Sermon was a healthy scratch, and instead of the third-rounder from Ohio State, it was another rookie, sixth-rounder Elijah Mitchell of Louisiana-Lafayette, who made noise. Mitchell played 35 of 55 snaps and carried 19 times for 104 yards and a touchdown (though he didn't see a target). JaMycal Hasty played 16 snaps, with his only carry being a three-yard TD run. He also had a 15-yard catch. The debate in fantasy this week has been whether Mitchell is worth the huge waiver expenditure it took to get him in FAAB leagues this week. A lot of fantasy managers believe Sermon is still the guy you want to have in this backfield. I touted Sermon throughout the offseason because I've seen the Shanahan family's zone-blocking scheme turn jobbers like Tatum Bell and Reuben Droughns into one-year wonders, while elite talents like Terrell Davis and Clinton Portis produced legendary seasons in it. If Sermon is an elite talent - and he sure looked the part at OSU last year - he could be an RB1 at a committee-back price. That could still be the case. But as a golfer, I also believe in playing the ball as it lies. For whatever reason, Shanahan used Mitchell over Sermon in Week 1, and then Mitchell proceeded to have a good game. It seems counterintuitive that Sermon would vault past Mitchell in Week 2. Sermon is an errant drive into the rough, and I'm not going to deceive myself about the reality of the situation by fluffing up a bad lie. I have Mitchell ranked RB23 this week and RB22 in the rest-of-season rankings. Sermon is RB48 this week and RB40 rest of season. Hasty is unplayable for now, but with all the Shanahanagans going on in this backfield, who knows? He could be the hot waiver add next week.",,,RB48,D-,6.4,1.9663
