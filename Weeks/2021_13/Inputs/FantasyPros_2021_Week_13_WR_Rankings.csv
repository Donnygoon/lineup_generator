He simply was not being utilized the correct way in this offense in New York and had been the definition of underwhelming over the course of his first season in town. In his first game sans Garrett, Golladay saw a 24% target share and reeled in three catches for 50 yards, which was his fourth-highest total of the season. While this certainly is still not what fantasy managers were expecting when they drafted Golladay this off-season, it seemed to be a step in the right direction for the veteran wideout. Unfortunately, it looks like we're going to have to remain cautious with Golladay from a fantasy perspective this week though with the downgrade at QB from Jones to Glennon. We've seen what Glennon can do in the NFL and it's nothing spectacular. He might lean on Golladay heavily in this game, but that's far from a guarantee. When you take into account what the quality of those targets may be, plus the tougher matchup now against Miami's secondary, it's probably best to view Golladay as nothing more than a low-end FLEX option.",sit,,WR43,C,10.2,0.40824
