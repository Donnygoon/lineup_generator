Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,JAC,1,2,1.0,0.2,"There may not be a better play this week than Bell. Not only did he just abuse the Ravens defense for 186 total yards and two touchdowns, but the Jaguars only point of weakness is against the run. They've now allowed four rushing touchdowns the last three weeks, including two to the seemingly incompetent Jets running backs last week. During those three weeks, they've allowed a league-high 517 rushing yards. Bell is an elite RB1 and I hope you took advantage of his panicking owners after Week 3. "
2,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,GB,1,9,2.5,1.2,"After a complete no-show against the Broncos in Week 2, Elliott has returned to fantasy glory over the last two weeks, totaling more than 40 points in standard leagues and seeing 50 touches. He should continue his recent trend this weekend against Green Bay, which has allowed more than 100 rushing yards in each of their past three games and five touchdowns to running backs in that span. Elliott has almost no chance of busting in this one, and should be considered a top-three play."
3,Kareem Hunt,KC,HOU,2,7,3.5,1.0,"The Redskins were able to keep Kareem Hunt in check last week, though that's a very loose ""in check"" because he still totaled more than 100 yards on the ground, but did not score. He still looked fantastic, though the loss of offensive guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif may hurt a little bit. The Texans allowed Leonard Fournette 100 yards on the ground in Week 1, but have not allowed more than 36 yards to a running back since. They've also held them in check through the air, which is why no running back has scored more than 5.5 PPR points outside of the Jaguars game. Hunt is still an RB1 for this game, but you may want to dial back expectations for the young phenom. "
4,Todd Gurley,LAR,SEA,1,8,3.9,1.3,"The matchup against the Seahawks doesn't look quite as bad as we thought for Todd Gurley, who is just 0.3 fantasy points off the top fantasy scoring running back. He's totaled at least 19 touches in every game and is averaging 26.5 touches per game. That is the territory where Le'Veon Bell and David Johnson last year, which is rare air. The Seahawks have allowed the combination of 49ers, Titans, and Colts running backs to rack up 393 yards on 68 carries (5.78 YPC) and two touchdowns the last three weeks. In his previous two meeting with the Seahawks, Gurley totaled 19/51/0 and 14/38/0 on the ground. His offensive line is clearing him nearly two full yards before contact, something that didn't happen last year, as he averaged just 1.0 yards before contact in 2016. Gurley is an RB1 even in this matchup. "
5,LeSean McCoy,BUF,CIN,1,9,5.0,1.4,"Since his outburst in Week 1 when he finished with 159 total yards, LeSean McCoy hasn't quite lived up to his price tag from fantasy drafts. He's actually still yet to find the end zone on a team that is 3-1, which isn't a great sign for his future projections. The Bengals are rock-solid up front and have yet to allow a team of running backs to average more than 3.78 yards per carry and they've actually gotten better every week. With that being said, McCoy needs to be played as an RB1 because he's going to be targeted a ton in the passing game. His 23 targets are the ninth-most in the league among running backs through four weeks, but the loss of Jordan Matthews frees up even more of them. Over the last two weeks, Ty Montgomery and Duke Johnson have combined for 17 receptions and 62 yards against the Bengals.  "
6,Carlos Hyde,SF,IND,4,12,6.7,1.5,"Despite being labeled a game-time decision last week against the Cardinals, Hyde thrived in the difficult matchup, totaling 95 all-purpose yards and averaging 4.3 yards per carry. He's still banged up with the hip injury, but he seems in no danger of missing this week's game at Indianapolis. The Colts have been fairly solid against the run this season, averaging just 3.7 yards per carry, but they've allowed five touchdowns to running backs, tied for second most in the league. Hyde should see a heavy workload here and get the goal-line work, and the potential for a score puts him in the solid RB1 category."
7,Leonard Fournette,JAC,PIT,3,12,6.9,1.8,"It's been a rough go for Leonard Fournette during his rookie year, as he's now seen a loaded box of defenders (eight or more) 51 percent of the time, which is the second-highest percentage in the league. Knowing that Blake Bortles cannot make them pay, opponents will continue to do this to him. The Steelers will have to regardless, as they have struggled to contain running backs not named Isaiah Crowell this year. Over the last three weeks, they've allowed the combination of Vikings, Bears, and Ravens running backs to combine for 385 yards on 69 carries (5.58 YPC). The concern is that the Jaguars fall behind early and are forced to go away from the run, but their defense should be good enough to keep them in this game, provided Le'Veon Bell doesn't tear them up early, which is entirely possible. Fournette should still have a good shot to score in this game, making him an RB2, at worst. "
8,Melvin Gordon,LAC,NYG,3,16,7.9,2.1,"It appears that Melvin Gordon may be more hurt than the Chargers are initially letting on, because he looked awful against the Eagles in Week 4, totaling just 22 yards on 10 carries. Gordon has never been the type to have a high yards per carry, but he's also now failed to reach 25 yards rushing in two of four games. The Giants have shown a weakness on the ground through four games, now allowing each team to total at least 99 rushing yards. A large part of that is because opponents are averaging over 27 carries per game against them. As of now, we must start Gordon if he's on the field in a good matchup, but also keep our high expectations at bay - he's a solid risk/reward RB2 in this matchup. "
9,Bilal Powell,NYJ,CLE,7,27,10.8,3.1,"It was good to see Bilal Powell get the majority of touches with Matt Forte out last week, but we aren't in the clear just yet. Rookie Elijah McGuire still played 19 snaps and carried the ball 10 times. It's not a clear workhorse scenario, so don't go assuming that Powell is an RB1 with Forte out. The Browns have actually played solid run defense with Jamie Collins out the last two weeks, allowing just 135 yards on 57 carries to the Colts and Bengals. Those two have pitiful offensive lines, though the Jets aren't much better. Powell is going to be an RB2/flex option with Forte out, simply because of the scarcity at the position. "
10,Jay Ajayi,MIA,TEN,5,21,12.4,3.8,"It's not a good time to own Jay Ajayi in fantasy leagues, as he's now totaled just 62 yards on 23 carries against the Jets and Saints defenses over the last two weeks. His knee may be a bigger problem than they're letting on, as he played 94 percent of the snaps in Week 2, but then saw that number dip to just 57 percent over the last two weeks. Against the Titans, who own one of the best run defenses in football, he's just a low-end RB2. They have held every opponent to less than four yards per carry, and the area where they allow the most production, the receiving game, Ajayi isn't very involved in.  "
11,Jordan Howard,CHI,MIN,8,20,12.9,2.5,"The matchup doesn't look great initially, but we cannot forget what Jordan Howard did to the Vikings last year. In the two games they played, he totaled 26/153/1 in the first game and then 23/135/0 in the second game. You have to consider him a low-end RB1 with all these positives surrounding him and scarcity of workhorses at the running back position. "
12,Lamar Miller,HOU,KC,9,30,13.1,3.2,"It was the Lamar Miller revival last week, as he reached double-digit fantasy points for the first time this year. Go figure that it came against a Titans defense who'd shut down running backs for the last two years. He's still a boring play most weeks, as he still hasn't topped 75 yards rushing since Week 14 of last year, despite averaging 17 carries per game. With that being said, Deshaun Watson helps create lanes for Miller because of his dual-threat ability. Something that often goes overlooked is what a mobile quarterback can do for his running backs. If you were to go and take a look at Alfred Morris with the Redskins under Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins, you'd see he was much better with Griffin under center. The Texans are involving D'Onta Foreman, but Miller is still the lead back, so keep trotting him out as an RB2. "
13,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,DET,7,27,13.6,4.1,"McCaffrey has been a huge disappointment this season, but he continues to average more than 13 touches per game and provide a decent floor for fantasy owners. This week's game against Detroit sets up well for the young back, as the Lions are solid against running backs but have allowed the seventh-most receiving yards to the position. That should mean that McCaffrey will have plenty of opportunities to do damage in the receiving game, and could be in line for his best game of the season. Still, despite the optimism, he's no more than a mid-range RB2 here until he shows fantasy owners something more."
14,Duke Johnson,CLE,NYJ,6,43,14.8,5.3,"Johnson is interesting because he's getting an increased role, but this game might not fit his ideal script of the Browns passing a lot, especially with Kizer struggling. Johnson has still yet to see more than four carries in a game, so he's just an RB4 this week in standard leagues, but an solid RB3 in PPR formats.  "
15,DeMarco Murray,TEN,MIA,8,27,15.0,3.7,"What is the most amount of carries that the Titans can give their running backs legally? I kid, but that's how I feel about what the Titans gameplan should be this week. The lone problem is that the Dolphins have been extremely good at stopping the run through three games. Keep in mind that they've played the Chargers, Jets, and Saints run games, which aren't exactly the Titans, but it's still impressive to see them allow just 3.29 yards per carry with two touchdowns. Still, jam DeMarco Murray into your lineups as an RB1 option. They are likely to run the ball 30-plus times this week.  "
16,James White,NE,TB,6,26,16.3,4.3,"There just isn't a way that I see the Bucs slowing down the Patriots offense. James White has been a solid PPR option, but has still yet to find the end zone through four weeks. His vital signs are good, as he's played over 50 percent of the snaps, including a season-high 61.4 percent last week. The Bucs did allow Tarik Cohen and Dalvin Cook 55-plus receiving yards in two of their three games this year and then allowed Wayne Gallman to score his first touchdown on a reception last week. White is a rock-solid RB3 in PPR formats, while he's more of a boom-or-bust RB3 in standard formats. "
17,Ameer Abdullah,DET,CAR,9,29,16.7,4.0,"Ameer Abdullah had been disappointing up until last week, but when you're continually getting 15-plus touches per game with his explosiveness, good things are bound to happen. Still, the offensive line isn't helping his cause and the Panthers are one of the better run-stopping teams in the league. Trot Abdullah out there as an RB3 this week, but don't expect too much against a team that has yet to allow a running back more than 56 rushing yards or 10 standard fantasy points. "
18,Tarik Cohen,CHI,MIN,8,28,17.6,3.9,"Cohen's production has fallen off in recent weeks, and last week's performance raises some red flags. Cohen saw just 18 snaps to Jordan Howard's 35, but Benny Cunningham also played 16 snaps. The Vikings are incredibly tough on opposing running backs, allowing the second-fewest fantasy points and fifth-fewest receiving yards to the position. It's unclear how Mitchell Trubisky's start will affect Cohen, but with the recent trend in his performance and the decline in his snap count, it's difficult to trust him as more than a Flex option this week."
19,Joe Mixon,CIN,BUF,6,31,18.6,5.0,"Joe Mixon now has 42 touches in two games since Bill Lazor has taken over, but he hasn't run away with the job like some thought he would. He's averaged just 2.6 yards per carry on the season, which is actually worse than that of Jeremy Hill's the last two years, an argument people have used to get him to the bench. Mixon is oozing with talent, but his patience doesn't work behind this offensive line that is one of the worst in football. They need to involve him more in the passing game to provide RB2 numbers consistently, but that won't happen as long as Giovani Bernard keeps taking passes to the house like he did against the Browns last week. "
20,Andre Ellington,ARI,PHI,8,36,21.7,5.3,"Ellington was by far the most effective Arizona running back on Sunday against the 49ers, gaining 106 total yards on 14 touches. Chris Johnson and Kerwynn Williams haven't been able to get anything going on the ground, and the Cardinals offense has been stagnant for some time. Ellington's an injury risk, for sure, but he's going to be heavily involved going forward, particularly in the passing game. He's an immediate add, particularly in PPR leagues."
21,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,BAL,7,35,22.0,4.6,"If Brandon Williams missing this game for the Ravens, I'm going to own so much Marshawn Lynch in DFS, it'll be embarrassing. Seriously, why do I do this to myself? Oh yeah, because the Ravens have been awful without him and Brent Urban on the defensive line. They have allowed the Jaguars and Steelers running backs to combine for over 425 total yards the last two weeks, including three touchdowns. The Raiders need a win and they aren't going to rely on Manuel to get it - Lynch needs to be played. "
22,Mike Gillislee,NE,TB,13,37,23.5,4.5,"If you're wondering whether or not to have Mike Gillislee in lineups, don't. He should be in the high-end RB2 conversation this week with the highest total on the board. Sure, he's been mediocre on the stat sheet over the last few weeks, but there are going to be plenty of scoring opportunities this week and we know he gets the goal-line work. The Bucs missing two linebackers is huge, as is safety T.J. Ward, should he miss another game.  "
23,Frank Gore,IND,SF,13,33,23.9,4.2,"The Colts are continuing to hand Frank Gore the ball 15 times per game, despite the fact that he has yet to top 57 rushing yards this season. If he doesn't score, he's useless in fantasy football, and he doesn't even get all the goal-line work. Outside of the two touchdowns the 49ers allowed Todd Gurley, they haven't allowed any other rushing touchdowns. They have also held opponents to just 3.55 yards per carry through four games, something nobody saw coming, especially without Foster on the field. Gore is a low-upside RB3 who lacks involvement in the passing game. Of course, you'll have the revenge narrative, but the Colts just simply aren't a good enough team to put him in position to score a lot. "
24,Doug Martin,TB,NE,14,57,25.1,6.5,"Martin returns from his suspension just in time for a juicy matchup against the Patriots. New England's defense has been historically awful, allowing the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and second most to opposing running backs. The Patriots are particularly susceptible to pass-catching backs, as they've allowed the most receiving yards and receiving touchdowns to the position. While that's not Martin's specialty, he's certainly been a competent pass-catcher before, and could easily exploit that hole in the defense. The biggest issue is how much Martin will play in his first game back, and there's no way to tell just yet. But the matchup and Martin's upside makes him a borderline RB2 option this week, even with the uncertainty."
25,Javorius Allen,BAL,OAK,17,36,25.2,4.3,"It's difficult to trust many running backs nowadays, but Allen keeps giving us more reasons to place him on our bench. After 21 carries in the opener and 18 carries in Week 2, he's totaled just eight and two carries the last two weeks, though he has seen six targets in three straight games. He's a risky flex option, though it helps that Alex Collins and Terrance West have both fumbled in the last two weeks. "
26,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,ARI,11,36,25.6,5.7,"Blount is somehow averaging nearly six yards per carry this season, and, outside from Week 2 where he received no carries, has been a fairly reliable fantasy option. But Doug Pederson likes Blount at around the 12-carry mark, and Wendell Smallwood and Corey Clement should continue to eat into Blount's work. Against a tough Cardinals defense, it's likely that Blount is going to need a touchdown to provide his owners with significant fantasy value, and it's hard to gamble on that. Still, given that several teams are on a bye and general question marks with running backs throughout the league, Blount still makes a borderline RB2 in this one, albeit a touchdown-dependent one."
27,Latavius Murray,MIN,CHI,11,42,27.3,5.7,"Although it was partly due to Jerick McKinnon's injury, Murray saw 20 snaps compared to McKinnon's five after Dalvin Cook's injury. Murray didn't do all that much with his work, gaining just 29 yards on nine touches, but he should be the goal-line back going forward with the potential for more now that Cook has been lost for the season. Given how successful he was in that role last year (12 touchdowns), he makes a fine add."
28,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,NYJ,13,41,27.4,4.8,"The addition of Jamal Adams has helped the Jets defense looked competent against running backs over the last few weeks, holding Jay Ajayi and Leonard Fournette to just 2.91 yards per carry and no touchdowns. With the way Crowell has played this season, it's right to question his future on your fantasy team. With that being said, it's not often the Browns have a chance to win a game, but this is one of them. The running back options get ugly outside the top-25, so Crowell remains in the RB3 conversation. "
29,Aaron Jones,GB,DAL,11,48,27.6,6.7,"Jones looked solid in emergency duty on Thursday against the Bears, gaining 49 yards on 13 carries and scoring a touchdown. It sounds like neither Ty Montgomery's nor Jamaal Williams' injury is significant, and it's unclear whether Montgomery will be able to play Sunday against the Cowboys. But Jones has likely earned himself some work even if Montgomery can suit up, so he makes a fine bye-week filler with the potential for more down the road. "
30,Theo Riddick,DET,CAR,10,42,27.9,4.7,"Riddick has just nine touches over his last two games, as the Lions continue to lean on Ameer Abdullah as their workhorse back. Abdullah is slightly banged up heading into Sunday's contest against the Panthers, and although Carolina is solid against running backs, they have allowed the most receptions to the position. That sets up well for Riddick, though it's nearly impossible to trust him in light of the limited touches. He's just a desperation Flex play in PPR leagues."
31,Wayne Gallman,NYG,LAC,18,46,31.5,5.1,"Paul Perkins' rib injury mercifully allowed Gallman to get some work, and he gave some life to the Giants' run game, gaining 42 yards on 11 carries and eight yards on two receptions with a touchdown. The Giants' offensive line is abysmal, but any starting running back (other than Perkins) is worth a look. Gallman has earned himself a starting role, and should at least find some success next week against the Chargers."
32,Alex Collins,BAL,OAK,17,51,32.6,5.3,"Collins got the start for the Ravens on Sunday against the Steelers, and again ran for 82 yards on nine carries, the same exact line as he had against Jacksonville the week prior. Collins has been electric, there's no doubt, but he's struggled with fumbling issues throughout his collegiate and professional career, including losing a critical one Sunday. Collins' talent and opportunity make him an immediate add, even though he'll cede some passing-down work to Javorius Allen. But his hold on the starting job is tenuous, as another fumble could cost him the role. Still, he's the clear back to own in Baltimore, and could provide big fantasy numbers if he can hold onto the ball. "
33,Giovani Bernard,CIN,BUF,22,45,33.0,4.5
34,Jerick McKinnon,MIN,CHI,22,47,33.2,3.9,"McKinnon injured his ankle in the fourth quarter on Sunday, which allowed Latavius Murray to get the primary work after Dalvin Cook's injury. McKinnon had been more involved than Murray this season, but had gained just 26 yards on 10 carries and 40 yards on eight receptions. If McKinnon is healthy, he and Murray will likely split work now that Cook is lost for the season with an ACL injury, similar to the breakdown last year between McKinnon and Matt Asiata. That makes McKinnon worth an add, especially in PPR leagues, but not someone to get overly excited about. "
35,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,DET,23,45,33.6,4.2,"Stewart continues to get plenty of work for the Panthers, but he's averaging just 3.9 yards per carry and has yet to score a rushing touchdown. The Lions are solid against the run, but they struggle more against pass-catching backs, having allowed the seventh-most receiving yards to the position. Given that Stewart has just three catches on the season, the game against Detroit sets up much better for Christian McCaffrey than for Stewart, and he's much more of an RB3 here."
36,Derrick Henry,TEN,MIA,28,46,37.6,3.4
37,Shane Vereen,NYG,LAC,30,58,38.1,4.5
38,Eddie Lacy,SEA,LAR,31,52,39.9,5.3,"After being inactive the previous two weeks, Lacy was not only active, but surprisingly effective in Week 4 against the Colts. He gained 52 yards on 11 carries, the majority of that coming before Chris Carson was injured. With Carson likely to be sidelined for some time with a broken ankle, Lacy should get steady touches, but it's difficult to know how the backfield work will be split in Seattle. Add Lacy, but don't waste significant dollars at this point."
39,Elijah McGuire,NYJ,CLE,26,48,40.5,3.9,"Matt Forte's injury opened the door for McGuire, and he busted his way through it, gaining 93 yards on 10 carries and a touchdown, and adding two receptions for 38 yards. Although McGuire was electric, so too was Bilal Powell, who nearly doubled him in terms of yards and saw 46 snaps to McGuire's 19. McGuire is an add, without question, particularly in light of next week's matchup against Cleveland. But be cautious - he'll still need to see a significant increase in snap count to have consistent value."
40,Thomas Rawls,SEA,LAR,27,56,40.7,6.3,"Rawls was a healthy inactive on Sunday night against the Colts, as the Seahawks opted to give Eddie Lacy the backup role to Chris Carson. Now, with Carson to miss significant time with a broken ankle, Rawls suddenly may become relevant again. Pete Carroll's comments after the game suggested that Rawls will at least be in the mix for a heavy workload going forward, but it's anybody's guess as to how the backfield will shake out. Rawls is an add, for sure, but it's tough to get too excited about him until we actually see him getting carries."
41,J.D. McKissic,SEA,LAR,22,64,43.2,8.2,"McKissic wasn't a familiar name in fantasy circles prior to Sunday night's game against the Colts, but he is now, after totaling 38 yards and a touchdown on four carries, and adding a 27-yard reception and a second touchdown. With Chris Carson out for a significant amount of time with a broken ankle, the Seattle backfield is wide open. But with the presence of Thomas Rawls, Eddie Lacy, and C.J. Prosise, it's unclear how McKissic will fit in going forward. He's an add, but it's hard to be too confident in his role going forward."
42,Chris Johnson,ARI,PHI,33,54,43.0,4.4,"Johnson belongs on waiver wires in fantasy leagues. He's touched the ball 40 times, but has scored just 12.8 fantasy points and in good matchups. He'll start losing more and more work to Andre Ellington, and it's not as if this matchup was great to begin with. "
43,Jacquizz Rodgers,TB,NE,22,60,44.3,7.5,"Rodgers performed competently in Doug Martin's absence, averaging 4.1 yards per carry in the Bucs' first three games. Martin returns just in time for a fantastic matchup against the Patriots, who give up the second-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. The exact workload split is unclear as of right now, but it's presumed that Martin will get the lion's share of the work immediately. Still, given the matchup and Martin's layoff, Rodgers is still in the Flex conversation for this week."
44,Jamaal Williams,GB,DAL,28,65,45.2,6.9,"Williams got his chance to prove himself last Thursday against the Bears but almost immediately injured his knee, which allowed Aaron Jones to get work and show himself to be a capable runner. Williams was expected to miss some time but isn't on the injury report and practiced fully this week, so he'll be ready to go on Sunday against Dallas. The Cowboys allow the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing running backs, but with the breakdown between Williams and Jones unclear, it's hard to start either as anything more than an RB3. "
45,Matt Breida,SF,IND,36,60,46.3,4.8
46,Chris Ivory,JAC,PIT,36,60,46.6,5.2
47,D'Onta Foreman,HOU,KC,39,55,46.4,3.5,"Foreman saw the most carries of his young career on Sunday against the Titans with 13, but nine of them came in the third quarter when the Texans had largely put the game away. Lamar Miller, on the other hand, had a huge day, with 23 touches and two touchdowns. This is Miller's backfield, for sure, but Foreman should continue to see eight to 12 touches per game on average, and would be an immediate RB2 if Miller got injured."
48,Jalen Richard,OAK,BAL,33,64,47.3,5.8
49,Dion Lewis,NE,TB,33,60,48.4,5.9
50,Corey Clement,PHI,ARI,29,74,51.8,9.2,"Clement saw 19 snaps and had 10 touches on Sunday against the Chargers, which presented a mixed bag. On the one hand, 10 touches from a running back is nothing to sneeze at when considering bye-week replacements and injuries around the league. On the other, Clement saw fewer snaps and had fewer touches than both LeGarrette Blount and Wendell Smallwood. With those factors, Clement would not ordinarily be a fantasy option this week against a Cardinals defense that is stingy against the run, but Smallwood has missed practice this week with a knee injury and appears in danger of missing the game. If he does, then Clement instantly becomes an intriguing Flex play who should see upwards of 15 touches. "
