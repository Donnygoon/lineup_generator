Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Travis Kelce,KC,HOU,1,6,1.4,0.7,"It was refreshing to see Travis Kelce get eight targets against the Redskins last week, as he always seems to deliver when targeted. A large part of that is because he's so efficient with his targets, catching 21 of 26 targets this year for 255 yards and two touchdowns. He's already halfway to his total of four touchdowns from last year. His closest comp is Rob Gronkowski, who just played the Texans two weeks ago and totaled 8/89/1 against them. Considering how good the Texans have been against running backs, it's only natural to think that more passes flow through to Kelce.  "
2,Zach Ertz,PHI,ARI,1,10,2.0,1.4,"Through four weeks, Ertz has seen a league-high 36 targets and sits as the No. 3 scoring tight end despite having scored one touchdown. With all that being said, the Cardinals take away tight ends in coverage. They have now held 21 of the last 22 tight ends they have played to 53 yards or less. Dating back to the start of last season, they've allowed just two touchdowns to tight ends, so it would make sense to fade Ertz in all of your DFS lineups this week, though he needs to remain put in season-long leagues with all the targets he's seeing.  "
3,Charles Clay,BUF,CIN,2,11,4.0,1.5,"Charles Clay actually saw his target share go up in Week 4 and now sits just over 25 percent. With Matthews shelved, that number isn't going to go down. The issue in relying on him so much in this matchup is that the Bengals have allowed just 94 yards to tight ends through four weeks. It may be a lack of talent against them, though, because they were brutal against tight ends last year, allowing more than 72 yards per game to them, and their defensive scheme didn't change this offseason. You have to keep Clay in lineups with the target potential he has, despite the tough matchup."
4,Delanie Walker,TEN,MIA,2,15,5.1,2.4,"Despite missing practice time last week, Delanie Walker was still heavily involved in Week 4 seeing seven targets, though it didn't amount to a big game or anything. Everyone receives a downgrade if Mariota sits, including Walker, though he did remain competent in the two games that Cassel played last year. The Dolphins aren't a bad matchup for tight ends, either, as they've been targeted 25 times, but turned those targets into 18/166/1. If Mariota is on the field, Walker needs to be in lineups, but if Cassel is, you may want to at least evaluate your other options available. "
5,Jimmy Graham,SEA,LAR,2,15,5.2,2.2,"The other pass-catcher who is targeted underneath for the Seahawks is Jimmy Graham, who has been a major disappointment through four weeks. He's still yet to score a touchdown despite seeing 26 targets, though you could choose to use that as a buy-low opportunity with the Seahawks run game struggling as much as they are. Tight ends have only seen 18 targets against the Rams, but on those targets, they've recorded 13 catches for 148 yards and two touchdowns, though oddly enough, both touchdowns were to backup tight ends (James Hanna, Garrett Celek). If Luke Willson scores a touchdown this week, so help me. "
6,Evan Engram,NYG,LAC,3,26,6.9,2.8,"Engram just continues to remain involved, after catching six of 11 targets for 62 yards on Sunday against the Bucs. He's now seen at least five targets and has at least four receptions in every game this season, and that level of involvement should give him a high weekly floor. In a year where reliable tight ends are few and far between, Engram makes an excellent add."
7,Cameron Brate,TB,NE,3,20,7.8,3.0,"Brate hasn't been all that affected by rookie O.J. Howard's presence, as he's now caught touchdowns in back-to-back games, including a four-catch, 80-yard performance on Sunday against the Giants. It's clear that the connection he showed with Jameis Winston last season has remained, and he'll be a fine, low-end TE1 going forward. "
8,Austin Seferian-Jenkins,NYJ,CLE,1,22,9.5,3.9,"Seferian-Jenkins has staying power in the Jets offense, as he caught all four of his targets for 46 yards on Sunday against the Jaguars. That gives him nine catches on 10 targets for 77 yards in two games. With few options at receiver, Josh McCown is looking to Seferian-Jenkins early and often, and his high involvement gives him a solid floor each week."
9,Martellus Bennett,GB,DAL,3,16,9.6,3.1,"It seems like every week I've been expecting Martellus Bennett to start clicking with Aaron Rodgers and though it hasn't happened yet, you really can't be comfortable with any tight ends outside of Rob Gronkowski, Travis Kelce, and Zach Ertz. He's fourth in targets, so they are forcing him the ball despite the lack of production. The Cowboys last three opponents have been Tyler Higbee, Jermaine Gresham, and Virgil Green, so don't pay too much attention to the overall stats they have allowed. This is a matchup against his former team, so you have the narrative, but it's also one where we're expecting a lot of points. Stop me if you've heard this before, but plug Bennett into your season-long lineups as your TE1 and it will pay off soon.  "
10,Jason Witten,DAL,GB,4,23,10.9,3.5,"After starting out the year hot as can be, Witten has tailed off significantly in the last two weeks, catching just two of his six targets for 12 yards. His life doesn't get much easier this week against the Packers, who allow the second fewest fantasy points to the position and have allowed just 12 catches for 106 yards over four games. This should be a shootout, so there's always a chance that Witten catches a touchdown or somehow becomes more involved. But he's only a borderline TE1 here, given his recent trend and the tough matchup."
11,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,CHI,4,17,10.9,2.6,"Who would have thought that targets would be an issue for Kyle Rudolph after he led the position with 132 targets in 2016? Even crazier, is that once Norv Turner left and Pat Shurmer took over, Rudolph was targeted even more. The emergence of Adam Thielen likely has a big role in that, but to be 20th among tight ends with 15 targets? His usage needs to go up and the Bears without two linebackers makes a lot of sense. Against the Bears in Week 17 last year, Rudolph destroyed them for 11 catches, 117 yards, and a touchdown. That was obviously with Bradford under center, but Rudolph should match up well with them once again. Consider him a low-end TE1 that should get back on the radar after a slow start.  "
12,Jared Cook,OAK,BAL,6,18,12.3,2.4,"Jared Cook has a plus-matchup on his hands as well, but the question remains on whether or not Manuel can support a fantasy option in the passing game. Cook has been a bit of a headache himself throughout his career, so it's tough to add another negative variable to the equation. The Ravens have allowed a 147.9 passer rating on 17 targets to tight ends through four games, but Cook still comes with plenty of risk. Consider him a TE2 in this matchup, though it should have been one to target.  "
13,Hunter Henry,LAC,NYG,2,22,12.4,4.0,"If there was any clarity on which Chargers tight end would see the majority of targets this week, I'd be all-in on them. Still, you do want to pick one because the Giants cannot defend tight ends. Through four weeks, the tight end position has seen 35 targets against the Giants, which has produced a massive 27 catches for 302 yards and five touchdowns. This is even worse than last year where they allowed the fourth-most yardage to tight ends, but just four touchdowns on the year. Hunter Henry is definitely the one with the most upside, as he can rack up yardage, as well as touchdowns, whereas Antonio Gates is a touchdown-or-bust player at this stage in his career. Henry played a season-high 61 percent of snaps in Week 4, so maybe we're seeing a change of the guard? He comes with plenty of risk, but what tight end doesn't? Play Henry as your TE1 in season-long leagues and target him in DFS tournament lineups. "
14,Benjamin Watson,BAL,OAK,4,18,12.8,2.4,"Ben Watson has been used more than anticipated in the passing game, and it can be argued that it's out of necessity at this point. With the wide receivers struggling, Watson has seen 17 targets over the last three weeks. The matchup against the Raiders is a pristine one, too, as they've allowed 218 yards and two touchdowns to tight ends on just 26 targets this year. Down a cornerback could further complicate their secondary, so Watson belongs in the high-end TE2 conversation this week."
15,Antonio Gates,LAC,NYG,7,25,16.7,3.9
16,Tyler Kroft,CIN,BUF,7,24,16.7,3.3,"Kroft had a huge game on Sunday against the Browns filling in for Tyler Eifert, as he caught six of seven targets for 68 yards and two touchdowns. Eifert may miss several more weeks, and while owners can't expect Kroft to deliver huge numbers every week, Andy Dalton clearly likes to target his tight end, making Kroft a streaming option."
17,Eric Ebron,DET,CAR,10,25,17.1,2.6,"It seems like Eric Ebron is getting the cold shoulder in the offense this year, as he now has less than 30 yards in three of four games. If you were to take out the matchup against the Giants (who are brutal against TEs), Ebron has just six catches for 45 yards and no touchdowns. It also doesn't help that he played a season-low 31 of 70 snaps in Week 4. Add in that the Panthers have been solid against tight ends this year and you have yourself a bench player.  "
18,Zach Miller,CHI,MIN,10,24,18.2,2.8,"The Bears are giving Zach Miller the lion share of snaps at the tight end position and he's running the most routes, so he's worth consideration. The Vikings have allowed 213 yards and two touchdowns to tight ends this year, and considering the Bears lack of options at wide receiver, Miller could turn into Trubisky's safety blanket. He belongs in the high-end TE2 conversation.  "
19,Jesse James,PIT,JAC,12,25,19.0,3.0,"James caught all three of his targets for 40 yards on Sunday against the Ravens, and has quickly reverted into what fantasy owners expected - a TE2 that should provide between 20 and 40 yards each week. He makes little more than a backup for fantasy purposes."
20,Dwayne Allen,NE,TB,8,38,21.0,6.8
21,Ryan Griffin,HOU,KC,11,67,20.8,6.3,"The Texans have somewhat of a timeshare at tight end between Ryan Griffin and Stephen Anderson, though Griffin is the full-time player. He's now seen 11 targets over the last two weeks, so he's someone to pay attention to, but the Chiefs aren't a team to stream tight ends against.  "
22,Julius Thomas,MIA,TEN,14,28,20.6,2.6,"The Dolphins have not used Julius Thomas much in the passing game, and rightfully so, as he moves like he's an old man who's suffered quite a few knee injuries. His 12 targets through three games are minimal at the position and it's hard to trust him as even a touchdown option with how few of points the Dolphins are scoring. He belongs on waiver wires.  "
23,O.J. Howard,TB,NE,11,37,24.8,4.3,"Howard has been on the field for more snaps than fellow tight end Cameron Brate, but he's clearly second in the pecking order among the position for the Bucs. Howard has seen just eight targets through three games and has just four receptions, though one was a 58-yard touchdown reception against the Giants last week where he was wide open. It's certainly a good matchup on Thursday - the Patriots have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends - but Howard's lack of consistent targets make him a TE2 at best."
24,Ed Dickson,CAR,DET,15,34,24.4,3.0
25,Jermaine Gresham,ARI,PHI,19,30,24.2,2.3,"It would need to be the greatest matchup of all time for Gresham to have fantasy relevance, and this weekend against the Eagles is far from that. The Eagles allow the seventh-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends, and Gresham has just 10 receptions for 74 yards through his three games played this season. He's not a fantasy option in any format."
26,Brandon Williams,IND,SF,14,41,31.0,6.0
27,George Kittle,SF,IND,17,35,25.7,3.5,"It's been somewhat of a disappointment for George Kittle, who has played a team-high 78 percent of snaps at the tight end position, but has just 83 scoreless yards to show for it on 14 targets. Even in a plus-matchup against the Colts, you can't play him with any confidence. I'm not convinced the Colts are well equipped to keep tight ends in check, but they haven't really been tested, as there have been just 21 targets to tight ends through four games. They have allowed 14 receptions for 213 yards and two touchdowns. If you want a low-owned option in DFS, he's not the worst play, but I think you can do better. "
