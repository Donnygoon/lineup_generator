Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Aaron Rodgers,GB,DAL,1,7,1.4,0.8,"Rodgers has had to throw the ball quite a bit this season, and ranks third in the NFL in pass attempts. He'll now take on a Dallas defense that has allowed the fourth-most passing touchdowns and sixth-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. Rodgers didn't have his best games of the season in his two matchups with the Cowboys last year, but the Dallas secondary is far worse in 2017. That matters little, anyway, as Rodgers is pretty much always a top-two play."
2,Tom Brady,NE,TB,1,5,1.9,0.8,"The Bucs secondary has been abused by both Mike Glennon and Case Keenum, who both threw for 300-plus yards and combined for four passing touchdowns. Eli Manning even somehow managed to throw for 288 yards and two scores last week, despite his lackluster offensive line. Brady is a can't miss QB1. "
3,Jameis Winston,TB,NE,1,11,3.6,1.3,"If anyone was still worried about Winston's ability to be an elite fantasy option after his first two games, their questions were answered in Week 3 against the Giants. Not only did Winston throw for 332 yards with three touchdowns, but he became the first quarterback to top 20 fantasy points against the Giants since the beginning of the 2016 season. He'll now take on a Patriots defense that single-handedly resurrected Cam Newton's fantasy season this past week, and he'll get to do it at home on a short week. The Patriots have allowed the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, and there's no reason to think they'll be able to contain Winston in this one. He's a strong QB1 play."
4,Dak Prescott,DAL,GB,1,22,4.2,2.4,"Prescott just keeps getting better and better in each game, and he's likely in line for his best effort of the season in Week 5 against the Packers. Putting aside his success last year in the teams' two matchups (549 passing yards and six touchdowns), this game sets up particularly well for Prescott. Although the Packers have been stingy against opposing quarterbacks, allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points to the position and just four touchdown passes on the season, their secondary is incredibly banged up right now and the Cowboys have an implied total of 27 points. Prescott has thrived in difficult matchups against the Giants, Broncos, Cardinals, and Rams, and should have no trouble putting up big numbers in a likely shootout. He's a top-five play here, easily. "
5,Russell Wilson,SEA,LAR,2,10,4.8,1.3,"After starting out slow (like he always does), Wilson has thrown for 668 yards, six touchdowns, and then run for 64 yards and a touchdown over the last two contests. The Rams are a great team to continue his hot streak against, as they have allowed at least 27 points in each of their last three games, including 39 points to the 49ers a few Thursdays ago. Despite throwing just 36 and 37 times, both Brian Hoyer and Dak Prescott were both able to eclipse 22 fantasy points. "
6,Matthew Stafford,DET,CAR,4,21,7.8,3.3,"Stafford's fantasy production has slowed in recent weeks, as he had just one touchdown pass over the last two games. He's averaging just 6.43 yards per attempt this season, but that may work in his favor against the Panthers this weekend. Carolina has allowed a 71 percent completion rate on passes thrown 10 or fewer yards downfield, which sets up well for Stafford given his play so far this year. He is unlikely to put up a huge game here, but he should provide a fairly solid floor and be firmly in the QB1 discussion."
7,Deshaun Watson,HOU,KC,5,17,8.2,2.2,"Watson followed up his breakout performance in Week 3 against the Patriots with a truly historic performance in Week 4 against the Titans, accounting for five total touchdowns. We've seen Cam Newton and RG3 become fantasy stars as rookies, so there's no reason to expect Watson to suddenly fall off dramatically. Still, New England and Tennessee have awful pass defenses, and Watson will draw the Chiefs in Week 5, so expectations need to be tempered just a bit. But don't kid yourself - Watson is an immediate add for all teams who don't have a stud at quarterback, and has the potential to be a difference-maker. "
8,Carson Wentz,PHI,ARI,2,19,9.1,2.8,"Wentz has been a better real life quarterback than fantasy quarterback the last two weeks, leading the Eagles to wins over the Giants and Chargers despite throwing just one touchdown pass and failing to top 250 yards passing in each game. The Cardinals are tough on the pass, though they're no longer elite, and the Eagles have an implied total of nearly 26 points. Traveling to the East Coast and coming off of an overtime game, it's a fair bet that the Arizona defense will provide Wentz with plenty of opportunities for success. He may lack huge upside, but he should make a borderline QB1 here."
9,Eli Manning,NYG,LAC,5,18,10.0,2.5,"With the return of Odell Beckham Jr., Manning and the Giants offense have found their form. Over the last two games, Manning has tallied 654 yards passing with five touchdowns and two interceptions, with a rushing touchdown added on. Both the Chargers and Giants are desperate for their first win, but Los Angeles is traveling east for this one, and the Giants are on the rise. Playing in front of his home crowd, Manning makes a solid QB1 option against a decent but unspectacular Chargers pass defense."
10,Carson Palmer,ARI,PHI,5,22,10.1,3.0,"Palmer has put up decent fantasy numbers this season, but that's because he's had to throw the ball so much, attempting at least 48 passes in three of the first four games. He'll now travel to the East Coast to face the Eagles, which presents a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the Eagles secondary is truly awful, as they're allowing 285 passing yards per game. On the other hand, the Eagles have tallied 10 sacks, and the Arizona offensive line is having trouble keeping Palmer upright. Palmer's receivers are mostly healthy, which should allow him to exploit the Eagles cornerbacks if he gets the time to throw. But his weak offensive line and the early start time make him a borderline start in anything other than two-quarterback or SuperFlex leagues."
11,Cam Newton,CAR,DET,5,23,10.8,2.9,"Newton proved he could still be fantasy relevant last weekend against the Patriots, throwing for more than 300 yards and accounting for four touchdowns. But this is hardly the same matchup in Detroit against a good Lions team that has allowed the fourth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. The Lions have given up just four passing touchdowns and have seven interceptions, so it's easily Newton's toughest matchup on the season. On the road for the second consecutive week, Newton is likely going to turn back into the pumpkin that he had been prior to last week."
12,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,JAC,6,23,12.2,3.5,"He's scored at least 17.5 fantasy points in each game at home since the start of last season, but this is one of his toughest matchups yet. The Jaguars have a great pass-rush, maybe the best in football, with a 12.9 percent sack rate, while no other team is above the 9.7 percent mark, which is the Steelers, ironically. According to PFF, Roethlisberger has completed 17 of 32 passes while under pressure for 173 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. It's hard to knock him out of the QB1 territory while at home, but he doesn't come with the upside he typically does at home. "
13,Philip Rivers,LAC,NYG,5,20,12.5,2.6,"It's not been a wise idea to start a quarterback against the Giants in recent memory, as Jameis Winston was the first quarterback to throw for three touchdowns against them since Week 15 of 2015. Considering Rivers' lack of rushing ability (lets be real, it's non-existent), it's going to be extremely difficult for him to reach QB1 territory in this game. The Chargers have done a much better job protecting Rivers this year, as he's only been sacked six times through four games, and the Giants haven't generated much pressure on opposing quarterbacks. With all of these factors, Rivers isn't as bad of a start as you'd initially think, but he's only starter-worthy in 2QB formats.  "
14,Alex Smith,KC,HOU,4,18,12.9,3.0,"Alex Smith is playing the best football of his life, but he's been sacked on 11.7 percent of his dropbacks, which is the second-highest rate in the league, while the Texans have sacked opposing quarterbacks on 10.0 percent of their dropbacks over the last three weeks, which is the second-highest mark in that time. Houston also does a good job of limiting opposing quarterback's attempts, as their opponents are averaging just 27.8 attempts, the lowest in the league. Add it all up and Smith isn't a great play in this matchup on the road.  "
15,Andy Dalton,CIN,BUF,8,26,16.2,3.0,"Dalton has had quite the bounce-back against the Packers and Browns, but the Bills have been much tougher on opposing quarterbacks. Through four weeks, they have allowed a combined one passing touchdown to the combination of Josh McCown, Cam Newton, Trevor Siemian, and Matt Ryan. They also held each of them to less than 260 yards passing. Dalton has been hot, but this game isn't one to target. He's just a low-end QB2 in this game. "
16,Jacoby Brissett,IND,SF,7,25,16.3,3.2,"Jacoby Brissett had his best outing against the Browns, something that shouldn't shock anyone. The 49ers aren't far off, though. Through four games, they have allowed the 10th most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, which has included at least one passing score in each game. They allowed mobile quarterback Russell Wilson to rush for 34 yards back in Week 2, meaning they aren't exactly zeroed in on shutting down a mobile quarterback. He's an option in 2QB leagues. "
17,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,CIN,7,23,16.8,2.8,"This game has one of the lower totals of the week at just 39 points, including an implied team total for the Bills of just 17.8 points. That's not ideal when talking about your starting fantasy quarterback. Granted, Taylor has a solid floor with his legs, but it hurts not having a legitimate receiver to throw to, outside of Charles Clay. The Bengals have kept tight ends in check this season as well, meaning it'll be even tougher on him. The Bengals did allow Deshaun Watson to scamper for a long touchdown run against them back in Week 2, so there's hope for him, though that was without their best linebacker, Vontaze Burfict, on the field. Taylor is just a QB2 in this game."
18,Jay Cutler,MIA,TEN,11,26,18.9,3.2,"It's been a nightmare scenario for those in 2QB leagues who added Jay Cutler, as he's been awful in two prime matchups. The odd part is that he's completed a career-high 67 percent of his passes to this point, but nothing that's led to points. This is another matchup to exploit for most quarterbacks, and despite what he's done to you the last few weeks, he's back on the QB2 radar with some upside. They've allowed a league-high 11 passing touchdowns, including eight in the last two weeks to Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson. They also stop the run very well, so the air will be one of their only ways to move the ball. It's never easy trusting Cutler, but he's in a great spot to succeed against a pass-rush that is nearly non-existent. "
19,DeShone Kizer,CLE,NYJ,7,25,20.1,3.2,"DeShone Kizer looksâ€¦ like a rookie who was forced to play too soon. He was pulled in Week 4 for backup Kevin Hogan, leaving you with zero confidence to start him despite the solid matchup. With that being said, head coach Hue Jackson made it clear that Kizer would be the starter going into this game. The Jets allowed both Tyrod Taylor and Derek Carr to walk all over them, but held Jay Cutler and Blake Bortles in check over the last two weeks. The two who succeeded had better offensive lines and Kizer has already been sacked 11 times, though he's dropped back to pass more than most. Kizer should offer a solid floor in 2QB formats while playing at home, but nothing more. He lacks the wide receivers to have a true breakout performance.  "
20,Sam Bradford,MIN,CHI,11,29,20.3,4.1,"Bradford practiced in a limited capacity on Thursday and Friday, which suggests that he will make his return to action after being out since Week 1. It's a Monday night game against the Bears, so unless there's clear word by Sunday, you can't possibly start Bradford absent having Case Keenum on your bench. If Bradford does play, it's difficult to know what to expect. He was incredible against the Saints in Week 1, but it's unclear whether that was simply a product of the matchup or whether Bradford had truly taken a step forward. The Bears are middle of the road against opposing quarterbacks, so the safe play would be to consider Bradford a low-end QB2 if he does wind up making the start."
21,Jared Goff,LAR,SEA,12,27,20.1,2.8,"Goff looks entirely comfortable and composed in Sean McVay's offense, as he's now thrown five touchdown passes and no interceptions in consecutive victories over the 49ers and the Cowboys. But he's far from a fantasy stud at this point, and that's especially so when you factor in his upcoming schedule: vs. Seattle, at Jacksonville, vs. Arizona, Bye, at New York Giants, vs. Houston, and at Minnesota. Goff's upcoming schedule, plus his lack of explosiveness, makes him much more of a depth add than a savior at quarterback."
22,Brian Hoyer,SF,IND,4,26,20.0,3.0,"It's hard not to at least consider playing a quarterback against the Colts, as they've allowed each of the four quarterbacks they've played to score at least 15.9 fantasy points, including 47.7 over the last two weeks to DeShone Kizer and Russell Wilson. They both scored a rushing touchdown, something Hoyer won't do, but he's still in play in 2QB formats. In the three games he's struggled in, they were against the Panthers, Seahawks, and Cardinals - shocker. He should be able to post a minimum of 250 yards and a touchdown in this contest. "
23,Josh McCown,NYJ,CLE,3,27,21.9,3.7,"Before Myles Garrett enters the picture, the Browns have allowed multiple passing touchdowns in 24 of their last 30 games. Their lack of pass rush has been obvious, but with Garrett in the picture, McCown will be on the run. He's already been sacked 12 times through four games, including five times just last week. McCown is fine in 2QB leagues, but don't get cute and use him as a streamer in standard leagues. "
24,Case Keenum,MIN,CHI,14,31,25.6,3.9
25,Blake Bortles,JAC,PIT,10,28,23.9,2.5
26,Mitch Trubisky,CHI,MIN,16,29,25.5,2.7,"Trubisky will make his first career start on Monday night at home, but he's walking into a tough situation. The Vikings have allowed the 10th-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks and an average of just 268 yards passing, which includes matchups with Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, Jameis Winston, and Matthew Stafford. Trubisky looked comfortable in the preseason, but it's anyone's guess how this game will turn out. If you own Trubisky, it's impossible to start him in his first week unless you have no other options."
27,Joe Flacco,BAL,OAK,11,29,25.5,2.4,"It's been a brutal start to the season for Joe Flacco and it's unlikely to get better any time soon. The Ravens offensive line is in shambles and their run game cannot get anything going. The Raiders have one of the best pass rushes in football, so it's got to be in the gameplan to get the ball out of his hands as quick as possible. Most teams have been able to carve up the Raiders defense through the air, as Josh McCown, Kirk Cousins, and Trevor Siemian have combined to throw six touchdowns the last three weeks. They also may be without starting cornerback David Amerson, who suffered a concussion in Week 4. Flacco is nothing more than a QB2, and a risky one at that, simply because he doesn't have enough protection to get the ball downfield to guys like Mike Wallace and Breshad Perriman. "
28,EJ Manuel,OAK,BAL,19,30,27.0,2.2
29,Matt Cassel,TEN,MIA,20,30,26.9,2.0
30,Mike Glennon,CHI,MIN,29,31,30.0,0.8
