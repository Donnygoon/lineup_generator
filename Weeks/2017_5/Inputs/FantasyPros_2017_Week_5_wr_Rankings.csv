Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Jordy Nelson,GB,DAL,1,11,3.0,1.6,"Nelson hasn't quite put up huge yardage totals, with just 206 yards receiving in (essentially) three games played this season. But he has five touchdowns already, and he should be in line for another huge day on Sunday against Dallas. The Cowboys give up the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and their secondary is both injury-riddled and ineffective. The game is expected to be high-scoring, and with the possible absence of Davante Adams and Ty Montgomery, Nelson will loom even larger in the gameplan. He's a top-five wide receiver this week."
2,Antonio Brown,PIT,JAC,1,10,3.4,2.0,"Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant both have tough matchups ahead of them this week, as both Jalen Ramsey and A.J. Bouye have shown shutdown ability. Combined, the Jaguars have not allowed a single wide receiver more than 59 yards. You'll never sit Brown, but it may be wise to dial back expectations in this matchup. Ramsey has allowed just 42 yards in his coverage all year, but Roethlisberger has never been shy about targeting Brown in one-on-one matchups, so fire him up as a WR1 in season-long leagues, but avoid in DFS."
3,Odell Beckham Jr.,NYG,LAC,1,15,3.4,2.2,"Beckham suffered a grotesque finger injury against the Bucs last week, and is still battling an ankle injury, but he looks set to play on Sunday against the Chargers absent a setback. He'll draw Casey Hayward in coverage. who has been extremely tough on opposing wide receivers, including shutting down Alshon Jeffery last week (Jeffery's touchdown came when Hayward was not covering him). Still, you don't bench Beckham if he plays regardless of the matchup, and he should still easily finish as a WR1 here. But the circumstances, with his injury and drawing Hayward, are not ideal."
4,Mike Evans,TB,NE,1,94,4.3,12.4,"Evans caught a touchdown for the second time in three games on Sunday against the Giants, but totaled just 67 yards receiving on five catches (out of 11 targets). While the touchdown was nice, it's worth noting that Evans was largely shut down by Janoris Jenkins, catching just 1-of-4 targets for 14 yards in Jenkins' coverage. That should give Evans owners only the slightest bit of pause in a sensational matchup against the Patriots on Thursday, as New England has allowed the fourth-most points to opposing wide receivers. But Bill Belichick loves to take away an opponent's top weapon, and there's no doubt that Evans fits the bill, so expect safety help on Evans nearly every play. Still, there's obviously no sitting Evans, particularly in light of the juicy matchup. But don't be surprised to see another poor target-to-catch ratio for the big receiver."
5,A.J. Green,CIN,BUF,1,10,4.7,2.0,"A.J. Green is always going to be in your lineup and you're not going to allow rookie Tre'Davious White or newly-acquired E.J. Gaines scare you off of him. In fact, Gaines is dealing with a shoulder issue that caused him to leave the game versus the Falcons. Green is a must-play WR1 in this matchup. "
6,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,KC,1,12,6.4,1.9,"DeAndre Hopkins killed last week in a great spot and he is in a position to succeed once again this week, though you shouldn't expect a 10-catch, 107-yard performance like he had last week. Hopkins lines up at LWR or in the slot about 75 percent of the time, which means he'll avoid Marcus Peters in coverage a majority of the time. Instead, they'll pick on Terrance Mitchell as other teams have. He's yet to allow a touchdown, but he has allowed 320 yards in coverage. To give you an idea as to how much that is, we are one-quarter through the season, which means he is on pace to allow 1,280 yards in coverage. There was just one cornerback who allowed more than 850 yards in coverage last year. Hopkins is on the WR1 radar.  "
7,Dez Bryant,DAL,GB,2,14,7.0,2.4,"Dez Bryant posted his highest yardage total of the season last week against the Rams, but he should one-up that against the Packers this week. In the matchup between these two teams last year, Bryant saw 12 targets and hauled in nine of them for 132 yards and two touchdowns. It'll be interesting to see if the Packers stick second-round rookie Kevin King on Bryant, as he semi-shadowed A.J. Green a few weeks ago and did a solid, though not great job against him. Bryant is a WR1 in this contest regardless, but it's a matchup to watch, as the Packers drafted him for situations like this. "
8,Stefon Diggs,MIN,CHI,4,19,9.2,2.6,"Diggs excelled in a tough matchup last week against Darius Slay and the Lions, catching five of seven targets for 98 yards. Regardless of whether Case Keenum or Sam Bradford is throwing him the ball on Monday night against the Bears, Diggs should find success yet again. He'll likely be matched up against Kyle Fuller, who has struggled this season, but even if he draws Prince Amukamara, it's a matchup that Diggs should be able to win. He makes a WR1 play this week, and a strong one at that."
9,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,PHI,1,20,9.6,3.2,"Fitzgerald has really only had one great game this season - Week 3 against the Cowboys - but at least saved his fantasy day last weekend against the 49ers with a touchdown in overtime. He'll now get a prime matchup against an Eagles defense that allows the third-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. None of the members of the Eagles secondary presents a difficult matchup for wide receivers, but Fitzgerald in particular should be able to have a field day with Patrick Robinson, who has struggled significantly so far this season, in the slot. The Eagles have a strong pass rush and the Cardinals have trouble up and down their offensive line, which could combine to force shorter throws by Carson Palmer and allow Fitzgerald to rack up the targets. He's a borderline WR1 here in the solid matchup."
10,Keenan Allen,LAC,NYG,5,29,11.5,3.5,"Matching up with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Allen is going to fall in the high-end WR3 category, because as someone who's not a massive red zone target, it'll be harder for him to overcome tough matchups on a consistent basis. Still, you start him because of his high projected target share, but don't expect a 100-yard performance or anything. "
11,Brandin Cooks,NE,TB,6,22,11.7,3.3,"There are plenty of fantasy owners mad at Brandin Cooks after he bombed against the Panthers, making it three of four games where he's disappointed. When Brady doesn't have time, they aren't going to connect on the targets that Cooks is getting. According to NFL's NextGenStats, Cooks is being targeted an average of 19.2 yards down the field, which is the fourth-highest mark in the league. Knowing that Brady will have time to throw in this matchup and that cornerback Brent Grimes ran an unofficial 4.57 forty-yard-dash at the combine, you'll want to put Cooks back into your lineup as a high-end WR2 with big potential.  "
12,Doug Baldwin,SEA,LAR,6,32,13.2,4.2,"Baldwin will line up across from either Kayvon Webster, who has been dealing with some injuries and missed Weeks 2-3, or Troy Hill this week, which is a positive for him. With Aaron Donald blowing up the Seahawks offensive line, Wilson is going to need to get the ball out of his hand as fast as possible, and Baldwin has the lowest air yards per attempt on the team at just 8.8 yards, while Richardson is at a very high 14.9 yards down the field. Baldwin looked healthy against the Colts playing near a full complement of snaps, so get him back in your lineup and trot him out as a low-end WR1 this week.  "
13,Tyreek Hill,KC,HOU,6,27,13.4,3.9,"It hasn't been a great year for those who were the Tyreek Hill can be a No. 1 wide receiver crowd, as he's just too reliant on the big play to be a consistent fantasy producer. With that being said, the Texans are prone to big plays, as evidenced by Brandin Cooks' breakout performance in Week 3 when he tagged them for 131 yards and two touchdowns. Hill has also played better on the road throughout his short career, though that may be more situational in a small sample size. The turf in Houston sure cannot hurt, though. Play him as a high-upside WR2/3 option, as you normally would. "
14,Golden Tate,DET,CAR,10,20,15.6,2.5,"Tate has alternated big games with quiet ones, as he caught 17 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown in Weeks 1 and 3 (both at home) but had just seven receptions for 54 yards and no scores in Weeks 2 and 4 (both on the road). If the pattern holds, Tate should be in line for a big game on Sunday against the Panthers, and signs are pointing toward just that. Carolina has been mediocre against wide receivers this season, but they've been particularly vulnerable to slot receivers, as Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, and Brandon Coleman all found significant success when playing out of the slot. At home, Tate should have another big day."
15,Devante Parker,MIA,TEN,6,29,15.7,3.4,"Despite the struggles of the Dolphins offense, Devante Parker has produced solid numbers, as he is the No. 17 wide receiver on a point per game basis. Going against the Titans who have allowed a top-12 wide receiver in every single week, this could be his breakout performance. Parker needs to be in lineups as a WR2 this week and makes for a solid DFS option against the combination of Adoree Jackson and Brice McCain, who have really struggled in coverage. "
16,T.Y. Hilton,IND,SF,1,26,15.7,4.4,"T.Y. Hilton was another one with a tough matchup last week, just one game after destroying the Browns for 153 yards and a touchdown. The 49ers lack a difference maker in their secondary, making Hilton a strong play, even with Brissett under center. Hilton has always been better inside of the dome with his wheels as well. The 49ers have allowed three 100-yard wide receivers in the last two weeks. Consider Hilton a high-upside WR2 for this contest.  "
17,Jarvis Landry,MIA,TEN,5,26,16.0,3.5,"Jarvis Landry's matchup isn't bad against Logan Ryan, who was burnt in coverage against the Dolphins last year while with the Patriots. In that game, he allowed 6/66/0 on just seven targets. It's tough to like Landry too much when Parker has such a great matchup, but Landry should still be in fantasy lineups as a WR3.  "
18,Chris Hogan,NE,TB,6,25,16.7,4.3,"Chris Hogan has to slow down at some point. I mean, he's not going to score 16 touchdowns this year, the number he is on pace for. His 26 targets are a team-high at wide receiver, but Danny Amendola back on the field hurts his target upside, as they both operate underneath in this offense, though Hogan can also go downfield. Don't shy away from starting Hogan as a WR3, but know that regression is coming."
19,Randall Cobb,GB,DAL,7,31,18.1,3.7,"Other than missing a game with an injury, Cobb has had an excellent fantasy season, catching 19 passes on 25 targets for 189 yards and a score. He'll now go up against a weak Dallas secondary that has allowed five touchdowns to opposing wide receivers this season and has allowed the eighth-most fantasy points to the position. Cobb has a solid history against the Cowboys, with 22 catches for 196 yards and a touchdown in his last three games against them. In a likely shootout, Cobb should make a fine WR2."
20,Pierre Garcon,SF,IND,11,28,18.9,3.0,"We knew it would be a long week for Pierre Garcon against Patrick Peterson last week, but life gets better for him against the Colts this week, though Vontae Davis has returned to the lineup. Truth be told, though, is that Garcon moves all over the formation and will evade Davis' coverage a majority of the time. Oddly enough, no pass catcher has caught more than five passes against the Colts, though nine of them have totaled more than 50 yards receiving. Consider Garcon a rock-solid WR3 in this matchup who may score his first touchdown of the year.  "
21,Adam Thielen,MIN,CHI,10,36,19.9,3.8,"Thielen has had a fantastic season thus far, ranking third in the league in receiving yards. But if the Bears have a true strength on defense, it's defending the slot receiver, which Thielen primarily is at this point. Through four weeks, the Bears have allowed just 14 catches for 148 yards and a touchdown to slot receivers. Regardless of whether Sam Bradford returns, Thielen should be in for a tough matchup. Still, his success this year makes him a borderline WR2, but owners should temper expectations."
22,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,ARI,7,45,23.7,6.0,"Alshon Jeffery has had an abysmal start to his schedule this year and Week 5 is no different. The Cardinals will stick Patrick Peterson on him in coverage and that'll be that. Jeffery will need to be moved around an awful lot to avoid his coverage, but still, don't expect anything more than WR3 numbers. Dez Bryant scored against them, but still ended with just two catches for 12 yards.  "
23,DeSean Jackson,TB,NE,15,37,24.2,3.1,"The Patriots have always done a great job with opposing No. 1 wide receivers, rolling coverage their way, but what will they do about Mike Evans and Jackson? It's likely that Jackson will be in man coverage with no safety over the top more often than not, making him a solid play. "
24,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,DET,14,42,25.4,4.3,"It appears that Kelvin Benjamin is healthy after playing almost all the snaps against the Patriots, but gets to come back in a matchup against Lions shadow cornerback Darius Slay this week. Benjamin is a massive target to cover at 6-5, 240 pounds, so you can never rule out a touchdown, but Slay has decent size and has already intercepted two passes this season, while allowing just 6.3 yards per target in coverage. Benjamin is more of a WR3 this week than the WR2 you likely drafted him as. "
25,Rishard Matthews,TEN,MIA,17,52,28.0,6.1,"Rishard Matthews has clearly been the No. 1 option in his absence, seeing 18 targets, though it really hurts his potential with Mariota dinged up. The Dolphins have really struggled against opposing No. 1 wide receivers, allowing Keenan Allen 9/100/0, Robby Anderson 3/95/1, and then Michael Thomas 8/89/1. The only issue is Mariota and whether or not he plays. If he does, consider Matthews an upside WR4. If Matt Cassel is forced to start, I wouldn't want to play any of the Titans pass catchers. "
26,Danny Amendola,NE,TB,16,44,28.6,5.2,"Amendola has a solid matchup with Robert McClain in the slot, but you have to wonder how many times Brady will go that route with time in the pocket. He should be considered a WR4/5 in this contest. "
27,Amari Cooper,OAK,BAL,16,47,29.3,5.4
28,Sterling Shepard,NYG,LAC,21,43,31.0,4.5,"Shepard has quietly had an extremely efficient and effective season, catching 21 of 27 targets for 254 yards, which is the most among Giants receivers. He'll now be the primary beneficiary of Casey Hayward's prominence in the Chargers secondary, as the cornerback will be on Odell Beckham Jr., leaving Shepard to contend with Desmond King, who is easily beatable. Shepard still makes a borderline WR3 here, but one with a fairly decent floor in light of his solid yardage totals this season."
29,Sammy Watkins,LAR,SEA,22,56,31.5,7.0,"Sammy Watkins has been targeted just nine times in the three non-49ers games, making him a bench-worthy candidate against the Seahawks this week, as he'll see plenty of Richard Sherman in coverage. They almost never have Sherman shadow opposing wide receivers, but I wonder if this is one of those situations, because if he doesn't, Watkins will only be on his side of the field roughly 25 percent of the time. I own Watkins in a few places and I'll be looking for other options if possible. Consider him a high-risk WR4 in this game, as the Seahawks have yet to allow a wide receiver more than 85 yards this season, and they played against the Packers. "
30,Devin Funchess,CAR,DET,21,44,31.6,4.4,"Funchess took on the huge role that fantasy owners had been waiting for on Sunday against the Patriots, hauling in seven of nine targets for 70 yards and two touchdowns. Although the performance was exciting, the Patriots have been historically awful against the pass, and this was just the second time in Funchess' career that he had more than four receptions. With Greg Olsen's injury, Funchess is an add, but don't break the bank just because of Sunday's performance."
31,Davante Adams,GB,DAL,16,78,31.3,14.4,"Adams has been practicing on a limited basis all week, but still has yet to clear the concussion protocol. The only good news is that this isn't an injury where fantasy owners will have to wait until Adams warms up to see if he can go - word should come down if Adams has cleared the protocol well before kickoff.  If he does play, Adams makes a decent WR2, as the Cowboys allow the eighth-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, and the game is expected to be a shootout."
32,Tyrell Williams,LAC,NYG,22,46,31.7,5.5,"Without knowing what the Giants plan to do with Janoris Jenkins, it's tough to trust Williams, because he'd be the most likely target in shadow coverage. Going into New York to play against another 0-4 team that is desperate may not be the key to success. He's a risky play this week. "
33,Michael Crabtree,OAK,BAL,13,54,31.7,6.2
34,Martavis Bryant,PIT,JAC,18,53,33.6,5.5
35,Jaron Brown,ARI,PHI,19,69,34.8,7.3,"Brown saw a whopping 12 targets on Sunday against the 49ers, hauling in eight of them for 105 yards. Perhaps more importantly, he played 82 of 86 snaps, while John Brown (54) and J.J. Nelson (24) saw significantly less action. Brown isn't exciting, but he's clearly the No. 2 wide receiver in Arizona at this moment, and his heavy involvement (29 targets the last three weeks) make him exactly the type of add that fantasy owners should be targeting. "
36,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,OAK,20,55,35.1,6.2,"There won't be many people on Jeremy Maclin after his last two performances, but you should be back on him this week, as he's the only wide receiver who can fill the role they need this week. As mentioned in the quarterbacks section, the Raiders bring a ferocious pass rush and the gameplan must involve Flacco getting the ball out quickly. Maclin has walked into the old Steve Smith role which includes him in the slot close to 70 percent of the time. The Raiders may be without starter David Amerson, who has been bad himself, so you can only imagine what his backup Dexter McDonald must look like. T.J. Carrie is the slot cornerback for them and he's allowed 15 of 20 passes thrown his way to be completed, though he's yet to allow a touchdown. You can definitely do worse than Maclin as your WR3 this week.  "
37,Allen Hurns,JAC,PIT,23,54,35.5,5.8,"Allen Hurns will match-up with Mike Hilton, who has stolen the nickel cornerback role from William Gay, and has done very well with his opportunity. Hurns isn't an option in season-long leagues, outside of a desperation bye week filler option, though you can do better. "
38,Cooper Kupp,LAR,SEA,24,54,38.5,5.4,"After a quiet game in Week 3 against the 49ers, Kupp came back to relevance against the Cowboys, gaining 60 yards and five catches and scoring a touchdown. The problem for Kupp is two-fold. First, the upcoming schedule is daunting, with games against the Seahawks, Jaguars Cardinals, Giants, Texans, and Vikings, with a bye week mixed in. The second is that as both Kupp and Sammy Watkins have showed, there's no way to know who will be getting the targets from week to week for the Rams. Add Kupp, but he's not likely to be a startable option for the foreseeable future. "
39,Will Fuller,HOU,KC,27,75,40.6,7.1,"Fuller returned from his collarbone injury and made an immediate impact on Sunday against the Titans, catching four of six targets for 35 yards with two touchdowns. He started last year off hot, too, before cooling considerably, but Deshaun Watson has this Texans offense humming right now. He's an exciting add for those in need of receiver help, and should be the most targeted wideout."
40,John Brown,ARI,PHI,27,90,41.2,10.0,"Brown made his return to action last week, and though he played only about 60 percent of the snaps, he made an impact. Not only did Brown catch three passes for 47 yards, but he also drew a critical pass interference call in overtime and nearly caught a game-winning touchdown. Brown's snaps should increase this week, and he should see plenty of chances for success against an extremely weak Eagles secondary. While still not a safe option, he makes a potential WR3 play here."
41,Brandon Marshall,NYG,LAC,25,59,42.0,5.4,"Marshall has seen a big uptick in targets in recent weeks, as he's seen 21 over the last two games as compared to just nine in his first two games. But that hasn't translated into all that much fantasy production, as he's tallied just 14 receptions and 112 yards receiving in that span. The matchup against the Chargers sets up well for Marshall, as the Los Angeles secondary is weak outside of Casey Hayward, now that Jason Verrett is lost for the season. But until Marshall shows more than middling numbers, he's simply a WR4."
42,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,CLE,29,56,42.6,5.4,"Kearse's star has certainly dimmed in recent weeks after his two-touchdown performance in Week 2 against the Raiders. He did see seven targets (the most since Week 1) and have four receptions on Sunday against the Jaguars, but gained just 17 yards. Relying on the Jets offense is never a recipe for success, and Kearse makes much more of a depth piece for your bench than someone you want to stick in your lineup each week."
43,Marqise Lee,JAC,PIT,28,60,41.9,5.8,"It's one thing to get volume out of a wide receiver, but not when he's continually in the toughest position to succeed. Marqise Lee will see Artie Burns in coverage about half the time, which is far from ideal, considering Burns has really stepped up since the Steelers traded away Ross Cockrell, allowing just 61 yards on 21 targets in coverage this year. Joe Haden, on the other hand, hasn't been the cornerback they hoped he'd be, allowing a team-high 181 yards in his coverage through four weeks. The Jaguars would be wise to move Lee over to the right side of the formation more often this week, which would make him a solid WR4-type play in a game where they'll need to throw more than usual.  "
44,Marvin Jones,DET,CAR,24,58,43.8,5.6,"Jones has yet to total more than three catches or 42 yards in a game, so it's certainly difficult to trust him. But he's seen a ton of very tough cornerback matchups in Patrick Peterson, Janoris Jenkins, and Xavier Rhodes, and it's fair to expect him to produce more going forward. That could begin this week in a home matchup versus the Panthers, who don't have a shutdown cornerback. Jones hasn't shown that he's worthy of your trust, and makes only a borderline WR3 here, but this game could be the beginning of his path back to fantasy relevance."
45,Robby Anderson,NYJ,CLE,30,69,46.0,6.9,"Anderson had his second straight productive week, catching three of six targets for 59 yards. But he was barely involved for most of the game, and did most of his damage on one deep ball in the fourth quarter. Still, that's essentially what Anderson is - a deep play threat on a team that is limited at wide receiver. While there will be plenty of down weeks, Anderson's skill-set and the lack of other options make him an intriguing option in the right matchup, which includes next week against the Browns."
46,Kendall Wright,CHI,MIN,37,63,46.8,5.9,"Wright caught all four of his targets for 51 yards and a touchdown on Thursday against the Packers, after receiving zero targets the week before. The Bears are handing over the quarterback reins to Mitchell Trubisky for Week 5 against Minnesota, and the impact on Wright is unclear. But a possession receiver is often a new quarterback's best friend, and it's a fair bet to say that Wright will see more consistent targets going forward. Still, Wright doesn't have all that much upside, making him more of a bench piece."
47,Mike Wallace,BAL,OAK,34,65,47.4,5.6,"You don't want to rely on Mike Wallace a majority of the time, but considering he's not just a deep threat at this point in his career and he will be lining up across from a combination of sub-par cornerbacks, he deserves WR4 consideration with bye weeks here. "
48,Adam Humphries,TB,NE,20,66,47.2,9.7,"Humphries has been a fairly relevant piece of the Bucs' passing attack, hauling in six receptions for the second consecutive week. He's gained 138 yards over the past two games, showing that he's far more than just a short-range safety valve. Against the Patriots and their abysmal secondary on Thursday, Humphries could be an excellent sneaky play, and could have some staying value going forward. Still, while his consistent targets make him an add, his lack of upside keeps him from being someone to waste significant FAAB dollars on."
49,Tyler Lockett,SEA,LAR,26,68,48.8,6.7,"Lockett played on 50 of 68 snaps against Indianapolis on Sunday night, catching four of five targets for 67 yards and adding two rushes for 24 yards. Lockett has shown before that he is almost always successful when he plays, and it's more a matter of if he can stay healthy. He certainly looks healthy now, and he can easily be a third wide receiver most weeks. But there's a ton of depth these days on the waiver wire at the position, so even with his likely success, there's no reason to waste a ton of free agent dollars on him. "
50,Paul Richardson,SEA,LAR,37,59,49.5,4.5,"Like Tyler Lockett, Richardson played on 50 of 68 snaps on Sunday against Indianapolis, and caught all three of his targets for 65 yards. With Jimmy Graham and Doug Baldwin healthy, Richardson is unlikely to provide significant fantasy value going forward, as Lockett appears to be the No. 2 wide receiver. Richardson has scored two touchdowns already, but he's more of a depth add. "
51,Kenny Stills,MIA,TEN,31,69,50.2,5.8
52,Eric Decker,TEN,MIA,9,69,50.4,7.5,"The Eric Decker signing looks really bad right now, as he's a non-factor in much of anything. On 20 targets, he's produced just 104 scoreless yards, while rookie Taywan Taylor has played a fraction of the snaps, but has totaled 93 total yards on just nine touches. Decker is off the fantasy radar and belongs on waiver wires.  "
53,Nelson Agholor,PHI,ARI,30,67,50.4,7.4,"Agholor has come crashing back down to earth since his big first game against the Redskins, totaling just six catches for 87 yards in the three games since. His matchup this week against the Cardinals isn't a terrible one. Although Patrick Peterson limits No. 1 wide receivers well, he'll be plastered to Alshon Jeffery, which should leave Agholor to face off against Tyrann Mathieu, who has looked far from the dominant force he once was. Agholor can't possibly be started in fantasy leagues right now, but he could be an incredibly cheap DFS option."
54,Donte Moncrief,IND,SF,36,73,53.8,6.2,"Donte Moncrief got the touchdown last week, but he hasn't topped 64 yards since Week 12 of 2015. The 49ers are always a good bet to allow a touchdown, but Moncrief comes with high volatility as a WR4/5 option with Brissett under center. "
55,Robert Woods,LAR,SEA,30,70,54.9,5.7
56,J.J. Nelson,ARI,PHI,35,79,56.5,7.3,"Nelson played just 24 of 86 snaps last weekend against the 49ers, significantly less than each of the other three Arizona wide receivers. He has remained limited this week in practice with his hamstring injury, which is obviously still hampering him. This weekend presents a great matchup with the Eagles, who give up the third-most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers. But with John Brown's return from injury and Nelson's limited snap count, he's nothing more than a boom or bust low-end WR4."
57,Geronimo Allison,GB,DAL,41,104,64.1,16.2,"With Randall Cobb being active, Allison received zero targets, after getting eight of them the week before. Fantasy owners know what to do with Allison - if the Packers are down a receiver, he's a viable play, but not otherwise. It's unclear whether Davante Adams will recover from his concussion in time for this weekend's game against Dallas, but if he doesn't, Allison would be a sneaky start. Without knowing this early in the week, however, it's not worth much to find out."
58,Zay Jones,BUF,CIN,36,79,58.7,8.8,"It's been a nightmare start to the season for Zay Jones, who now has just 57 yards on 17 targets. By comparison, Johnny Holton of the Raiders caught one pass this weekend and already has more yardage than Jones. Still, he's going to see an increased target share going forward, but in this matchup, it's not enough. The combination of Adam Jones and Dre Kirkpatrick have shut down perimeter wide receivers and it's unlikely that the Bills go three-wide very often. Jones is still just a WR4/5 option, even with Matthews out of the lineup. "
59,Ricardo Louis,CLE,NYJ,41,78,59.6,8.9
60,Terrance Williams,DAL,GB,32,74,57.7,6.8
61,Torrey Smith,PHI,ARI,37,78,60.5,8.2,"Torrey Smith may be the hidden treasure here, as the Cardinals have allowed guys like Kenny Golladay 4/69/2 and Brice Butler 2/90/1. Nelson Agholor will draw Tyrann Mathieu, while Smith with have Justin Bethel. Smith likely doesn't need to be used in season-long leagues, but he could be an interesting tournament option in DFS.  "
62,Cole Beasley,DAL,GB,33,74,60.0,6.4
63,JuJu Smith-Schuster,PIT,JAC,39,82,62.2,7.7,"With Eli Rogers inactive, Schuster served as the primary slot receiver, catching three of four targets for 47 yards and a touchdown. Schuster has now seen 14 targets in the last three games, but has gained just 102 yards in that span. He's, at best, the fourth target for Ben Roethlisberger, so his chances of being a consistent fantasy asset are limited."
