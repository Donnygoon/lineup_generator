1,Pittsburgh Steelers,PIT,JAC,1,17,2.4,2.5
2,Minnesota Vikings,MIN,CHI,1,10,2.7,1.9,"The Vikings D/ST has started producing more in recent weeks, totaling two sacks and three interceptions against the Bucs in Week 3 and six sacks against the Lions in Week 4. The Bears have allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs, and will now be starting rookie Mitchell Trubisky on Monday night. While a rookie quarterback is usually a good thing for any defense, the Vikings D/ST was essentially guaranteed to have success against a Mike Glennon-led Bears team. Trubisky adds a variable to the mix, though it doesn't affect the Vikings' defensive projections much. The D/ST still makes a fine play in Week 5. "
3,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,ARI,1,14,4.3,2.6,"The Eagles D/ST has been solid all season long, ranking fourth in turnovers and 10th in sacks. They'll now take on an Arizona Cardinals team that is tied for the most sacks allowed (17) and has turned the ball over six times. The Cardinals are also traveling east, which usually means bad things for West Coast teams.  The combination of all these factors makes the Eagles D/ST an excellent option this week."
4,Seattle Seahawks,SEA,LAR,1,25,5.1,3.9,"The Seahawks D/ST finally had the big game everyone had been waiting for, tallying three sacks, two turnovers, and two touchdowns against Indianapolis. They'll now take on a Rams team that has allowed the fewest fantasy points to opposing D/STs. But the Rams have yet to be tested, and it's unclear how they'll be able to hold up against an elite unit like the Seahawks. Consider Seattle a borderline top-five option this week, and hope they continue their success from this past weekend."
5,New York Jets,NYJ,CLE,2,21,6.7,3.6
6,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,HOU,2,19,7.5,3.3,"There will be a lot of people scared off the Chiefs defense after the Texans just hung 57 points on the Titans, but you shouldn't be one of them. The Texans offensive line is still bad without left tackle Duane Brown, who is still holding out. Deshaun Watson was sacked 7 times in just one and a half games against the Bengals and Jaguars, don't forget that. "
7,Buffalo Bills,BUF,CIN,1,20,7.6,3.3
8,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,OAK,1,22,9.7,4.9
9,New York Giants,NYG,LAC,2,28,10.4,4.0,"The Giants D/ST has been generally disappointing all season, scoring just 13 total fantasy points through four games. The Chargers aren't particularly generous to opposing D/STs, allowing the 13th-fewest fantasy points to the position. With Philip Rivers and the Chargers traveling to the East Coast, it's possible that they'll be sluggish and provide some opportunities to make plays. But the Giants D/ST makes no more than a low-end starting option in most fantasy leagues."
10,Cincinnati Bengals,CIN,BUF,1,20,10.7,3.8
11,Oakland Raiders,OAK,BAL,2,22,11.4,4.0,"The Ravens offensive line is in pieces up the middle and it wasn't even great before losing both of their starting guards Alex Lewis and Marshal Yanda. One of the few things that the Raiders do well is get after the quarterback, so take the free sacks this week, on top of the fact that Joe Flacco has now thrown at least one interceptions in 13 of the last 14 games (including 10 straight), and you have yourself a streaming defense. "
12,Detroit Lions,DET,CAR,1,20,11.5,4.1,"Even considering that the Panthers had an offensive explosion against the Patriots last weekend, the team still allows the 10th-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs, which includes matchups against the 49ers, Bills, and Saints. Cam Newton has been sacked 12 times already this season, and the Lions are the top-scoring D/ST on the season. They should provide a big game here. "
13,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,PHI,2,26,12.0,4.3,"The Cardinals D/ST hasn't been as strong as was initially advertised, largely because their secondary has struggled aside from Patrick Peterson. They've totaled nine sacks and three interceptions through their first four games. The Eagles aren't a particularly difficult matchup (about middle of the road in terms of fantasy points allowed to opposing D/STs), but in light of the game being in Philadelphia and the Cardinals playing on East Coast time, the defense is likely to be a bit sluggish. The talent on defense still makes the D/ST a startable option, but not by much this week."
14,Houston Texans,HOU,KC,3,25,12.6,3.5
15,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,PIT,5,26,14.4,3.8,"The Jaguars defense will be a start more often than not, but you just don't play defenses against the Steelers on the road. Ben Roethlisberger is a different player there, and on top of that, the biggest weakness of this Jaguars defense has been their ability to stop the run. Ahem, Le'Veon Bell just went for almost 200 yards and two touchdowns against the Ravens last week. Find another defense for the week."
16,Tennessee Titans,TEN,MIA,4,26,15.3,3.7
17,Los Angeles Rams,LAR,SEA,8,24,17.2,3.0
18,Los Angeles Chargers,LAC,NYG,7,24,18.5,2.7
19,Carolina Panthers,CAR,DET,4,24,18.3,3.8
20,Green Bay Packers,GB,DAL,1,28,20.2,5.0
21,Cleveland Browns,CLE,NYJ,7,24,17.8,4.7,"Getting Myles Garrett added to their pass-rush is going to help immediately. The Browns pass-rush has been one of the worst in the league, but the Jets offensive line may be the remedy. They are coming off a game in which they allowed Josh McCown to get sacked five times and really have no wide receivers to take advantage of the weak Browns secondary. "
22,Chicago Bears,CHI,MIN,8,28,20.2,4.3
23,San Francisco 49ers,SF,IND,4,27,20.7,4.3
