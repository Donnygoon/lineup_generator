The spinning carousel of QBs for New York certainly hasn't helped Davis get into a rhythm this year, but he's going to have back the QB that helped his fantasy value the most at the beginning of the season. From Weeks 1-7, Davis had a 20.2% team target share and he was averaging 11.8 fantasy points per game during that stretch. He's averaged just 7.4 fantasy points per game in his two games without Wilson and he should be excited to get the rookie QB back behind center. With Moore's emergence as a viable fantasy asset, we can't confidently rank Davis as anything more than a mid-range WR3, but there is at least some optimism heading into this plus matchup.",start,,WR101,F,4.2,26.100312499999998
