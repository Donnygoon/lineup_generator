Last year, Baltimore had a defense that ranked ninth in DVOA and a potent 1-2 punch at running back with J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards. This year, the Ravens' defense ranks 24th in DVOA, and season-ending injuries to Dobbins and Edwards have forced Baltimore to try spackling the position with Latavius Murray, Devonta Freeman, Ty'Son Williams, and Le'Veon Bell. As a result, Jackson is being forced to throw more because game scripts haven't been as friendly and because the Ravens can't lean on their running game. Jackson has thrown 225 passes through seven games. He threw 190 passes in his first seven games last year. That's five more pass attempts per game, and at his current average of 8.5 yards per pass attempt, that works out to an extra 42.5 passing yards per game. Jackson is also assuming more of the rushing load. He has 76 rushing attempts so far in 2021; he had 66 rushing attempts through seven games in 2020. Jackson has more than double the rushing yardage of any Baltimore RB. Although the Vikings haven't been an easy matchup, allowing just 16,5 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, Jackson is the overall QB2 this week and has a sky-high ceiling.

White was predictably ineffective in Week 7 when forced to sub for injured starter Zach Wilson, completing 20 of 32 passes for 202 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. Even with White getting a full week to prepare as the starter, it was hard to imagine the dramatic turnaround he gave us in Week 8. He completed 37 of 45 passes for 405 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions in the Jets' upset victory over the Bengals, and he finished second in QB fantasy scoring for the week behind only Josh Allen. White gets less time to prepare this week with the Jets visiting Indianapolis to face the Colts on Thursday. The Bengals may have fallen victim to complacency in Week 8 coming off a triumphant road win over the Ravens, but the Colts aren't likely to be complacent after a painful overtime loss to the Titans. White has thus far looked like a credible NFL passer, though his four interceptions in less than two games are a red flag. It's hard to imagine another 28-point fantasy performance from him, but I've got four QBs ranked behind White this week, and you're probably happy to have him if you play in a superflex or 2QB league.",,,QB25,F,13.9,0.19635555555555553
