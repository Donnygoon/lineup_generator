However, it's nowhere near translating to relevant fantasy production. Jones is averaging just 1.1 passing touchdowns per game to one interception and just over 245 passing yards per contest. With little to no mobility to his game to provide any sort of extra boost on top of that, Jones has a very small percentage chance of cracking the top-20 QBs any given week. Through six weeks, he's now the QB26 on the year and there's very little reason to look his way this week, despite the plus matchup. He's a low-end QB2 at best.",,,QB19,D+,15.4,0.2392071428571429

Assuming those fans are familiar with Lock's play, that's quite an indictment of Bridgewater. He actually ranks QB12 in fantasy scoring over the last two weeks, but his 622 passing yards and five TD passes over that span have been offset by four interceptions and seven sacks. Bridgewater's Week 6 numbers were artificially inflated by 22 fourth-quarter passing attempts, as the Raiders did a poor job of playing keep-away with a commanding lead. Not that Broncos head coach Vic Fangio is apt to cave into fans' demands, but the possibility of an in-game benching heightens the risk for any fantasy managers forced to bet on Bridgewater in Week 7. Plus, Bridgewater is now dealing with some sort of minor foot issue. He's going up against a staggering Browns defense that gave up four TD passes to Justin Herbert and Chargers in Week 5 and another four to Kyler Murray and the Cardinals in Week 7. Bridgewater isn't on par with those two premier passers, but this has been a different Cleveland defense than the one that terrorized Justin Fields and Kirk Cousins a few weeks ago. There's a wide range of possible outcomes for Bridgewater this week, but a ranking of QB21 reflects overall bearishness.",,,QB20,D,15.0,0.13140625

Garoppolo hasn't done much from a fantasy perspective up to this point of the season, but managers desperately need someone to plug into their lineups in Superflex or 2QB formats. Currently, the Colts are allowing the 6th-most fantasy points to opposing QBs and we know that it only takes one big play after the catch from Samuel to give Garoppolo fantasy relevance.

One of the better backups in the league, Keenum posted an 11-3 regular-season record as a starter for the Vikings in 2017 but couldn't sustain that level of success as a starter with the Broncos in 2018. Technically, there's a little bit of revenge-game narrative here, since the Broncos traded Keenum to Washington for sixth- and seventh-round draft picks in early 2019. Under normal circumstances, we could expect a run-heavy game script for the Browns, but with RBs Nick Chubb and Kareen Hunt both injured, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski may not have the luxury of taking a conservative approach Thursday against the Broncos. The Denver defense performed well in the first three games of the season against the Giants, Jaguars, and Jets, but Broncos head coach Vic Fangio and defensive coordinator Ed Donatell have watched their D collapse the last two weeks against the Steelers and Raiders. Still, with a banged-up supporting cast and limited prep time for a Thursday-nighter, Keenum ranks QB23 this week.",,,QB24,F,13.4,0.07102272727272728
