But there have been few saviors at the RB position in the generation since, so perhaps the young'uns are more in awe of Henry's greatness than the graybeards are. At the moment, the point differential between Henry and the RB2 in half-point PPR fantasy scoring is greater than the pint differential between the RB2 (Austin Ekeler) and the RB16 (Antonio Gibson).

He's faced some easier matchups the past couple of weeks against Seattle and the Giants and we're seeing what that means for fantasy purposes as he's delivered some big performances. Looking forward, Henderson now gets to take on the Lions defense that is allowing the most fantasy points to opposing RBs so far this season with an average of 25.2 points per game.

Up to this point of the season, Swift is averaging seven targets per contest and nearly 50 receiving yards. That volume more than makes up for his lack of production on the ground and it's especially valuable in any type of PPR format. This week against the Rams, we shouldn't expect much from Swift on the ground, but we know that the Lions are going to be playing from behind for the majority of the game.

In any normal week, starting Michel would be a very risky game to play. However, we know that the Rams are going to cover the gigantic spread in this matchup and they're most likely going to run the ball for the majority of the second half. Michel should be able to see enough work to be a viable fantasy asset this week for teams that are desperate for a starting option. There's certainly some risk involved as he will only be involved if the game is out of hand, but the path for relevancy is there.",,,RB41,D+,5.7,0.2819702702702703

It seemed as if Gaskin might have regained control of this backfield in Week 5, when he played 69% of the offensive snaps and had 10 catches for 74 yards and two touchdowns. That now appears to have been either a mirage or an opponent-specific gameplan against a Buccaneers defense that's impregnable against the run but can be had through the air. Last week, Gaskin played the same number of snaps as Brown (a 36% snap share for each) and had 5-9-0 rushing and 2-5-0 receiving. Woof. Even with six teams on bye, Gaskin is just a high-end RB3 this week. Ahmed, who at times looks like he has the most juice of anyone in this backfield, played 27% of the snaps in Week 6 and had a season-high seven carries. He's the RB44. Brown has had at least five carries in all five of the games he's played this year, but never more than eight. He's the RB45.
