Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Rob Gronkowski,NE,NO,1,5,1.2,0.8,"With Edelman, Mitchell and now Amendola out, Gronk should see an even larger workload. The Saints aren't terrible against tight ends, but in this shootout, Gronk could have his top performance of the season."
2,Travis Kelce,KC,PHI,2,6,2.8,1.1,"Philly has dominated tight ends over their last 20 games, but even with last week's no-show performance, he is just too good to consider benching in even the most shallow leagues."
3,Greg Olsen,CAR,BUF,2,7,4.2,1.3,"Olsen had a quiet opening to his 2017 season, hauling in just two of four targets for 18 yards on Sunday against the 49ers. He now gets a Bills team that was tough on tight ends last season, allowing touchdowns to only Rob Gronkowski and Jimmy Graham. Olsen will always be one of Cam Newton's favorite targets and will always be a start, but with Newton's rustiness and the Bills' past success on tight ends, expectations should be tempered here."
4,Jordan Reed,WAS,LAR,1,10,4.9,1.9,". You were warned that it was a bad matchup for Jordan Reed against the Eagles, and it's not a great matchup against the Rams, either. They allowed just 621 yards to the position last year and there were just have been just two tight ends who've totaled more than 52 yards against them in their last 17 games. Reed is likely a higher upside option than anyone else on your team, but this matchup isn't great. "
5,Jimmy Graham,SEA,SF,1,20,5.0,2.8,"In two games against the 49ers last year, Graham destroyed them for 10 catches, 164 yards and a touchdown in their two meetings. In a game where the Seahawks are projected to score 28 points, Graham is a good bet to find the endzone.  "
6,Zach Ertz,PHI,KC,1,15,5.0,2.5,"Ertz continued to show that he is one of Carson Wentz's favorite targets, catching in all eight of the passes thrown his way for 93 yards in Week 1's matchup against the Redskins. Week 2 should have presented a daunting matchup for Ertz, but Eric Berry's season-ending injury opens the door wide open for Ertz to thrive. The Chiefs, led by Berry, have been one of the best defenses against tight ends for several years, but they allowed eight touchdowns to the position in 2014 when Berry missed most of the season. Ertz is firmly a mid-tier TE1 in this one."
7,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,PIT,2,12,7.0,2.3,"Rudolph wasn't heavily involved in Week 1 against the Saints, but made the most of his limited action, catching all three of his targets for 26 yards and a touchdown. He'll now take on a Steelers defense that was middle of the road in 2016, and didn't have much of a test against the Browns in Week 1. Rudolph is one of Sam Bradford's favorite targets every week, so he always has a high floor and is a must-start option absent the worst possible matchup. Week 2's game against Pittsburgh is far from that, making Rudolph a mid-range TE1."
8,Delanie Walker,TEN,JAC,2,11,7.7,1.6,"The Jaguars have strong pass coverage all over the field including Myles Jack who is big enough and fast enough to line up against pass catching tight ends like Walker. He is still a start in standard 12 team leagues, but it is much closer than usual this week."
9,Martellus Bennett,GB,ATL,3,15,10.0,2.2,"Bennett caught just three passes for 43 yards against the Seahawks in Week 1, but should have much more success against the Falcons in Week 2. Atlanta gave up the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends last season, and didn't look to have improved much against the Bears in Week 1. In a likely shootout, expect Bennett to see plenty of work, making him a rock-solid TE1 in this one."
10,Coby Fleener,NO,NE,5,16,11.0,2.2,"As he had done in the past, Fleener again made the most of Willie Snead's absence on Monday night catching five of his six targets for 54 yards and a touchdown against the Vikings. Don't be frightened by how the Patriots limited Travis Kelce in Week 1. As we know, the Patriots look to take away an opposing team's best weapon, and in Week 1, they clearly deemed that Kelce. Here, Fleener is far from the Saints' best weapon, and therefore should have plenty of opportunities to make plays. In a likely shootout and with Snead missing this game, Fleener makes a rock-solid TE1 this week."
11,Charles Clay,BUF,CAR,5,28,11.9,3.0,"With Jordan Matthews ailing and Sammy Watkins gone, there was reason to believe the Bills would continue to feed the ball to Clay, just like they did at the end of the last season. Granted, the Bills won't play the Jets every weekend, but Clay performed well and could be this year's Dennis Pitta, seeing targets upon targets all season."
12,Tyler Eifert,CIN,HOU,7,19,11.6,2.6,"The Bengals offensive line is the sole reason they were held to 0 points, but that isn't the only reason Eifert put up a bust week. Rather, it is that Dalton threw the ball to him just 1 time all week. That should change this week, but going against Houston should concern owners enough to consider benching him if they have another strong option."
13,Jason Witten,DAL,DEN,8,25,13.0,3.3,"Witten showed he still has fantasy relevance with his 7-59-1 performance against the Giants in Week 1. He now gets to take on a tough Denver secondary, which just shut down the combination of Hunter Henry and Antonio Gates. Denver generally bottles up tight ends, although Travis Kelce torched them in both matchups in 2016. Witten's value comes more from the fact that he's one of Dak Prescott's only reliable weapons, and defenses focus on taking away Dez Bryant. Witten is far from a safe play here, and should be considered more of a mid-range TE2."
14,Eric Ebron,DET,NYG,7,23,15.4,3.6,"The Giants are a stomping ground for opposing tight ends, as they allowed 87-year-old Jason Witten to rack up seven catches for 59 yards and a touchdown last week. The 1,052 yards they allowed to tight ends in 2016 was the fourth-most in the league. They only allowed four touchdowns to them, but Ebron doesn't score touchdowns, right? He's a low-end TE1 this week. "
15,Jared Cook,OAK,NYJ,8,23,16.0,3.1,"The Titans' secondary is nothing to write home about, but Cook was one of the better tight ends in football during Week 1 with 5 receptions for 56 yards. He appears to be the #3 option in this solid offense, so if you are desperate for a tight end, he fits the bill."
16,Austin Hooper,ATL,GB,10,26,16.4,3.4,"Hooper had a monstrous line in Week 1 against the Bears, with 128 receiving yards and a touchdown on two catches. But his 88-yard touchdown catch-and-run was on a broken play, and both of his catches and targets came in the fourth quarter. That's not to say that Hooper won't be valuable in Week 2 against the Packers - far from it. Green Bay allowed the eighth-most yardage to tight ends in 2016, and Hooper was solid against them last year (five catches for 41 yards). Expect his yardage to obviously decline from Week 1, but expect more targets and catches, making him a borderline TE1 here."
17,Cameron Brate,TB,CHI,8,26,17.6,3.3
18,Zach Miller,CHI,TB,10,27,18.8,3.7
19,Antonio Gates,LAC,MIA,9,26,18.9,3.5,"You'll want to stream Antonio Gates this week, as it's likely he breaks the all-time touchdown record in the Chargers first home game against the Dolphins. There were 10 tight ends who saw five or more targets against them in 2016 and nine of them totaled at least 9.5 PPR points, including five of them to score 16.3 or more. Gates was actually one of them. "
20,Hunter Henry,LAC,MIA,10,40,19.8,4.3,"Henry has a nice big ceiling this week against a Dolphins defense who struggles versus tight ends, but he should only be on the field for 20 to 25 snaps, so he is by no means a safe start."
21,Julius Thomas,MIA,LAC,12,96,21.4,11.0
22,Evan Engram,NYG,DET,4,29,20.4,4.0,"Engram stepped up in Week 1 with Odell Beckham Jr. missing the game, catching four of five targets for 44 yards. While that stat line doesn't jump out at you, given the struggles of the Giants offense in the opener, it's quite noteworthy. Engram played about 80 percent of the snaps in Week 1, and the Lions allowed the third-most touchdowns to tight ends in 2016. If Beckham sits again, Engram should be a viable TE2 play, though he's probably someone to avoid for now if Beckham does suit up."
23,Jack Doyle,IND,ARI,13,29,21.1,3.4
24,Jesse James,PIT,MIN,9,27,22.0,3.7,"James did have two touchdowns in the Steelers' victory over the Browns, but don't forget that they just went out to acquire Vance McDonald, who is the more athletic option of the two tight ends. James may have a touchdown here or there, but is most likely not going to have another game like his Week 1 performance all season."
25,George Kittle,SF,SEA,16,33,25.6,3.3,"Kittle saw plenty of action in Week 1 against the Panthers, with six targets. He hauled in five of them, albeit for just 27 yards. You shouldn't be targeting any 49ers in a Week 2 matchup in Seattle against a tough and angry Seahawks defense. But the fact that Kittle saw six targets in Week 1 suggests that he'll be a big target of Brian Hoyer this season, and any tight end that will see significant volume makes a viable play. For now, consider Kittle just a mid-range TE2 in this matchup, but monitor him closely this week to see if he can become a potential matchup play in the future."
