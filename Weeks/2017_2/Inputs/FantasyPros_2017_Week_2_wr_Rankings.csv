Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,MIN,1,8,1.7,1.4,"Xavier Rhodes is one of the best shadowing cornerbacks in the NFL and he should be on Brown this weekend. Still, Brown is among the best receivers in the history of football and is as matchup proof as they come. He is still a top-end WR1 despite the tough opposition."
2,Julio Jones,ATL,GB,1,6,2.2,1.0,"Jones was held relatively in check in Week 1 against the Bears, hauling in four of his five targets for 66 yards. He'll now take on a Green Bay team that held him to just 29 yards in last year's regular season matchup, but which allowed him to total nine catches for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the playoffs. Jones is matchup proof, and this game has all the ingredients for a monster performance - likely shootout, home opener, and full health. Jones is one of the top one or two options at wide receiver in Week 2, obviously."
3,Jordy Nelson,GB,ATL,1,9,3.6,1.5,"Nelson had an excellent opening effort against the Seahawks, hauling in seven of his eight targets for 79 yards and a touchdown. Considering his performance against a tough Seattle defense, his fantasy owners should be licking their chops for Sunday's matchup against Atlanta. In two matchups against the Falcons last season, Nelson had 10 catches for 161 yards and two touchdowns. With a shootout pending, expect Nelson to once again perform like a top-10 wide receiver."
4,Mike Evans,TB,CHI,2,13,5.2,2.4,"Evans opens his season at home against the Bears, a team that held him to four catches and 66 yards last year in his only meeting with them. Although Chicago held Julio Jones in check last week, it's doubtful they'll have similar success against Evans. Fully rested and with a bevy of new offensive weapons, the Bucs should come out firing in their opener on Sunday. The additions of DeSean Jackson and O.J. Howard should force defenses to focus less on Evans, and he should have plenty of room to do damage in Tampa."
5,Brandin Cooks,NE,NO,1,12,5.7,2.3,"It doesn't matter who else is on your roster, Cooks needs to be played against his former team. The Patriots are out for blood and Cooks left on bad terms. Not just that, but the Patriots are running out of wide receiving options to throw to. If you witnessed what Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen did to them last week, it was a massacre. On top of the fact that they're not very talented in the secondary, they're without their top cornerback Delvin Breaux. It'd be shocking to see Cooks end with anything less than 80 yards and a touchdown. "
6,Michael Thomas,NO,NE,2,37,8.0,4.9,"Thomas, like most of the receiving options in the Saints offense, had a ho-hum first game, catching five of his eight targets for just 45 yards against the Vikings. Being limited by Xavier Rhodes is nothing to be embarrassed by, and the fact that Drew Brees continued to target Thomas all game despite the coverage is a good sign. Thomas now takes on the Patriots defense which,  although it has two solid cornerbacks in Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore, struggled mightily against Alex Smith and the Chiefs in Week 1. Bill Belichick likes to take away his opponent's best weapon on offense, and it's possible that he views that as Thomas. But, more likely, playing in New Orleans for the home opener, the Saints offense is going to explode, and Thomas should be one of the primary beneficiaries on Sunday."
7,Amari Cooper,OAK,NYJ,2,15,8.1,3.1,"Cooper had a big game last week, but it could have been even better considering all of the red-zone work he saw. This year could be the big breakout, and he could really propel himself forward with a huge Week 2 against a terrible Jets' secondary in what Vegas considers a likely very high-scoring game for the Raiders."
8,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,IND,1,18,9.6,3.1,"It didn't look great last week for the Cardinals, but Fitzgerald was still a target hog, seeing 13 targets against the Lions. Had he scored, his game would have looked a lot better. The Colts just allowed Cooper Kupp to look like a mini-Fitzgerald, hauling in four passes for 76 yards and a touchdown. With Carson Palmer turning into a checkdown machine, Fitzgerald should explode this week. "
9,Doug Baldwin,SEA,SF,6,22,10.3,2.8,"Baldwin was held relatively in check in Week 1 against the Packers, catching all four of his targets for just 63 yards. Russell Wilson was harassed all day and had little time to throw, so Baldwin can't shoulder too much of the blame. Expect a different story this week when the Seahawks return home to play the 49ers. Last year against the 49ers at home, Baldwin went off for eight catches for 164 yards and a touchdown. While you can't expect a repeat performance, Baldwin should still have a big game here as he and the entire Seattle offense looks for a rebound."
10,A.J. Green,CIN,HOU,3,18,7.5,2.6,"Green and the Bengals pass attack weren't able to get much done against Baltimore last week in the shutout because the offensive line was so terrible. This week, they draw an even better pass rush and even stronger secondary, so while Green is still an obvious start, he doesn't make our top 10 this week."
11,Keenan Allen,LAC,MIA,1,19,11.6,3.4,"Everyone seems to be excited about Melvin Gordon against one of the toughest run defenses in football this week. Rather, they should be looking to the passing game to do work against a mediocre secondary. Allen will be at the forefront of that in targets and likely yards."
12,Tyreek Hill,KC,PHI,3,25,12.3,3.5,"It won't be very often that you hear me say this, but Hill is a safe play in Week 2. The Eagles will be without their top cornerback Ronald Darby, who dislocated his ankle last week. Just last year, the Eagles allowed the third-most yardage in the league to wide receivers, which is where Hill should rack up points. He's not going to have 150-yard, two touchdown games, but he should see plenty of targets and exploit the biggest weakness the Eagles have, their secondary. "
13,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,DAL,8,19,13.8,2.7,"The Cowboys may have had their way with the Giants last week on defense, but that had more to do with Eli Manning and the offensive line melting down than it did the Cowboys' secondary talent. This secondary is among the bottom half of the league so Thomas should be considered a top 15 WR as usual."
14,Stefon Diggs,MIN,PIT,4,28,14.8,4.4,"The matchup for Diggs against the Steelers is better than it was just a few weeks ago when they had Ross Cockrell, who they traded away to the Giants. Why? Because they signed Joe Haden, who was cut by the Browns. In Week 1, Haden was targeted 10 times against the Browns and allowed seven catches for 109 yards. The Steelers are going to put up some points this week, which means more passing for the Vikings pass-catchers, and Diggs has the best matchup on the field. "
15,Michael Crabtree,OAK,NYJ,10,29,15.5,3.7,"Crabtree wasn't on the receiving end of a touchdown like Cooper and Seth Roberts, but he did lead the team in receptions and yards. There is a strong chance he hauls in a touchdown on top of all those yards this week against a less than mediocre Jets defense."
16,Odell Beckham Jr.,NYG,DET,2,44,15.6,9.3,"Beckham appears to be moving better this week in practice, but his discussion of how he has a ""six-to-eight week"" injury has put a scare into his fantasy owners. Giants beat writers expect Beckham to once again be a game-time decision, which puts fantasy owners in a real bind, given that the Giants play on Monday night. If Beckham does suit up, you have to think he's healthy enough to make an impact, and would be a must-start option against a Lions defense that looked tough on Sunday against the Cardinals, but generally struggled against the pass in 2016. Monitor the situation closely and, unless reports are good on Sunday morning or you have another Monday night option, be prepared to leave Beckham on your bench."
17,Golden Tate,DET,NYG,8,30,18.5,3.4,"Tate had a productive opener against the Cardinals, catching 10 of his 12 targets for 107 yards, while also gaining seven rushing yards on two attempts. The Giants have an elite secondary but, like the Cardinals, they don't really have a shutdown slot cornerback. That means that Tate should once again see plenty of targets on Monday night against New York, and he should be considered a low-end WR2."
18,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,LAR,11,34,18.9,3.7,"Pryor's first game with the Redskins was a mixed bag, as he got 11 targets and totaled a decent 66 yards, but had just six catches and dropped a long touchdown pass. Things don't get much easier in Week 2 against the Rams, who have an improving defense and dominated the Colts in Week 1 (though that's hardly saying much). The Redskins lack a strong running game, so expect them to continue to attack teams through the air, which should mean a high volume of targets for Pryor again in this one. He's a solid WR2 here, and hopefully he and Kirk Cousins can get on the same page, which will improve Pryor's outlook going forward."
19,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,CIN,7,32,16.6,4.4,"When Watson was on the field for the second half, he threw the ball Hopkins way more often than everyone else on the team combined. The Bengals do get Pacman Jones back from suspension this week, but that shouldn't slow down Hopkins from being a borderline WR1 this week."
20,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,KC,11,31,20.0,3.3,"Jeffery had a disappointing Eagles debut, catching just three of his seven targets for 38 yards. Although he had to deal with Josh Norman for much of the game, Norman did not shadow Jeffery, making the latter's dud all that more disappointing. Marcus Peters is one of the best cornerbacks in the league, but he doesn't shadow receivers, so Jeffery won't have to contend with him all game in the Eagles' Week 2 matchup against the Chiefs. Expect Carson Went to try to work in his best playmaker more in this one, and for Jeffery to improve on his sub-par Week 1 performance. He's still firmly in the WR2 range."
21,Davante Adams,GB,ATL,11,42,22.6,5.7,"Adams caught just three of seven targets for 47 yards in Week 1 against the Seahawks, but his fortunes should be better against Atlanta. Adams will almost certainly be paired up against Robert Alford, and that's a matchup that Aaron Rodgers will surely look to exploit. In a likely shootout, expect both teams to throw early and often, making Adams a viable WR2 in the matchup."
22,Emmanuel Sanders,DEN,DAL,10,36,23.4,5.0,"Denver ran the ball 36 times last week compared to just 28 pass attempts, but a large part of that had to do with the opponent. This week, it should be the opposite, as Dallas' pass defense is severely lacking compared to their run defense. Sanders shouldn't be quite as quiet this week and is a WR2."
23,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,BUF,12,40,24.9,4.5,"Benjamin had a disappointing start to his 2017 campaign, hauling in just one of five targets for 25 yards against the 49ers. But there's no reason to panic - Cam Newton looked rusty and the Panthers threw the ball just six times after the half, as the game was well in hand. The Bills have an entirely new secondary that wasn't tested against the Jets, but you can expect Newton to see what they're made of this week. Expect a high volume of targets for Benjamin, and a much better performance that Week 1, which leaves him as a WR2 in the Week 2 matchup."
24,Dez Bryant,DAL,DEN,12,38,25.6,4.2,"Bryant had a rough go of it in Week 1, hauling in just two of nine targets for 43 yards, though Dak Prescott missed him on a wide open slant in the end zone. He now draws an incredibly tough Broncos secondary, which hasn't allowed a receiver to top 100 yard since 2015.  Denver has an elite secondary, so whoever Bryant draws will be tough. Given the lack of other weapons in the Broncos' receiving game, expect Denver's defense to focus on taking Bryant out of the game, leaving him as a low-end WR2 at absolute best."
25,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,CLE,12,40,25.9,4.9,"The Ravens only threw the ball 17 times last week because Joe Flacco was just coming back from his back injury. Don't be too discouraged about Maclin, however, as Flacco led the league in pass attempts each of the last two seasons so that narrative should change in a hurry. It could start this week in a great matchup against Cleveland."
26,Randall Cobb,GB,ATL,14,39,26.3,5.3,"Cobb was impressive against the Seahawks in the opener, leading Packers receivers in receptions (nine), targets (13), and yardage (85). More than likely, that was due to game script, but it's worth noting that even in last year's down season, Cobb was effective against the Falcons, with six receptions on nine targets for 82 yards. Cobb has a long way to go before earning back fantasy players' trust, but in a likely shootout and on the backs of a solid Week 1, he makes a fine WR3 here."
27,Adam Thielen,MIN,PIT,14,44,27.2,6.7,"I don't necessarily think you need to sit Thielen, but you do need to be aware that he has the toughest matchup on the field this week. He'll draw William Gay in coverage, a slot cornerback who allowed just 351 yards and three touchdowns on 64 targets in coverage last year. Thielen does move outside a portion of the time, so he'll need to do his damage there this week. "
28,Martavis Bryant,PIT,MIN,14,95,28.4,10.7,"While Antonio Brown attracts Xavier Rhodes in coverage, Bryant will be left with Trae Waynes and 39-year-old Terence Newman in coverage. Now that he has his sea-legs under him, Ben Roethlisberger should be able to connect a few times in this contest. There wasn't a game last year where Roethlisberger scored less than 17.9 fantasy points at home and those points have to go somewhere. Does he come with risk? Sure, but not many players in this range come with his upside. "
29,Jarvis Landry,MIA,LAC,16,51,30.0,6.6,"Did you not witness what Bennie Fowler did to them out of the slot last week? The Chargers cornerback duo of Jason Verrett and Casey Heyward is among the best in the league, but they don't travel into the slot. Landry and the Dolphins have had a long time to prepare for this game and this is the one matchup that should be a no-brainer. "
30,Devante Parker,MIA,LAC,15,51,30.8,6.1,"You want to try and avoid matchups with Jason Verrett in fantasy football, and that's exactly who Parker will see in coverage this week. Verrett and Casey Heyward held the duo of Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders to just 8 catches for 93 yards and no touchdowns last week. This should be a Jarvis Landry week, so keep Parker on ice for now. "
31,Chris Hogan,NE,NO,17,41,31.3,5.9,"Chris Hogan was a disappointment against the Chiefs, despite being on the field for 73 of 81 snaps and matching up with backup cornerback Phillip Gaines a majority of the time. He needs to be a bigger part of this offense if they want to move the ball, so consider him a WR3 with upside for more against the Saints."
32,Sammy Watkins,LAR,WAS,22,47,31.6,5.6,"The Redskins didn't use Josh Norman to shadow Alshon Jeffery last week, which was a surprise, as they indicated this offseason that they would use him in clear No. 1 situations. This week is a real test then, because Cooper Kupp will operate out of the slot, giving the Redskins the option of using Norman on Watkins, or letting him cover Robert Woods. I'm not betting on Watkins in a matchup that could involve Norman. "
33,Pierre Garcon,SF,SEA,21,45,32.8,5.2,"Garcon led the 49ers in targets (10), receptions (six) and receiving yards (81) in the opener against the Panthers, but he now gets a much tougher test against an angry Seahawks team at home. Richard Sherman doesn't follow opposing wide receivers, so Garcon can avoid him if the 49ers gameplan correctly. While the Seahawks are surely a tough defense, they give up their fair share of receptions to opposing wide receivers, having allowed six or more receptions to 12 receivers in their last 14 games. Garcon's volume alone keeps him relevant, but the chances of him having a big game, considering he rarely factors into the discussion near the end zone, are limited. Consider him a low-end WR3."
34,T.Y. Hilton,IND,ARI,18,46,32.8,6.9,"Hilton has been a mediocre wide receiver throughout his career when Andrew Luck isn't passing to him. This week should be no different, and in fact, quite a bit worse going up against Patrick Peterson and the Cardinals. He is a flex-worthy play, but nothing more."
35,Jamison Crowder,WAS,LAR,22,58,33.8,4.9,"Crowder is purportedly battling a hip injury, and had an awful Week 1, catching just three of his seven targets for 14 yards and also losing a fumble. But, despite the injury concerns and the rough game, if Crowder is going to see seven targets or more each outing, he should provide plenty of value more often than not. With Trumaine Johnson likely to stay on Terrelle Pryor all game, Crowder may play the role of safety blanket for Kirk Cousins, and should see a high number of targets once again. He's a low-end WR3 in this one, with the potential for more."
36,DeSean Jackson,TB,CHI,22,58,33.8,5.9,"The Bears new duo of Eddie George and Quintin Demps at safety is going to take some time to gel and we saw it last week when Austin Hooper was able to take a shorter pass to the house, while stiff-arming Demps to the ground. The Bears have done a decent job with opposing No. 1 wide receivers under defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, making Jackson an intriguing WR3 with plenty of upside this week. "
37,Ted Ginn,NO,NE,22,51,37.3,5.3,"Ginn didn't really ""boom"" or ""bust"" in Week 1 against the Vikings, catching four passes for 53 yards. But all signs point to a full-on boom this week against the Patriots. Everyone knows that Bill Belichick looks to take away his opponent's best weapon - here, that's likely Michael Thomas. Expect Malcolm Butler plus safety help on Thomas all game, leaving Ginn in position to potentially make a huge play or two. At home in a likely shootout, Ginn is in a good spot, but his hit-or-miss history leaves him as a WR3 with upside."
38,Corey Coleman,CLE,BAL,19,61,38.6,6.7,"Kizer threw the ball to Coleman twice as often last week as he threw to Kenny Britt. This week, the defensive opponent is quite a bit harder, and Coleman's performance wasn't anything to write home about, but as the #1, he can be considered as a flex play."
39,Tyrell Williams,LAC,MIA,24,62,39.2,7.3,"As expected, Keenan Allen was the primary target for Rivers last week against the Broncos, but Rivers still threw the ball Williams' way 7 times for a team-leading 54 yards. All passing numbers should see a boost this week in a much more friendly matchup at home against the Dolphins."
40,Cooper Kupp,LAR,WAS,25,71,40.9,7.3,"Sammy Watkins is still getting his feet under him with the new offense and the Colts defense is less than pathetic without Vontae Davis healthy, but you still have to love what the rookie did in his first game. Kupp saw 6 targets for 76 yards and a touchdown. It is obvious that he will be a big part of this offense moving forward and makes for a solid depth piece for the rest of the season."
41,Corey Davis,TEN,JAC,25,86,43.3,8.1,"Despite the Titans' coach saying Davis would be used sparingly, he saw 10 targets in Week 1. Granted, the Jaguars have a terrific secondary, but with that type of usage, you can start Davis in the flex even against a strong defense."
42,Rishard Matthews,TEN,JAC,27,65,43.0,6.3,"Matthews was terrific to close last season, but with the additions of Corey Davis and Eric Decker, he should take a bit of a back seat. Last week, they were both banged up, but combined for 18 targets, so we shouldn't expect too much from Rishard against the Jaguars in Week 2. He can be squeezed into your flex in a pinch, but hopefully you have stronger choices."
43,Mike Wallace,BAL,CLE,30,63,43.7,5.8,"Last week, Joe Flacco took his first snaps after missing the entire preseason and so the Ravens only threw 17 times to ease him back in. We should see more of the same in what is expected to be a blow out against the Browns, but even with only 5 targets, Wallace is worthy of being started at the flex."
44,Brandon Marshall,NYG,DET,20,59,43.7,5.8,"Marshall looked awful in Week 1 against the Cowboys, rarely getting separation and making just one catch for 10 yards in garbage time. It's tough to draw any conclusions from the game, as Eli Manning was harassed and had almost no time to throw, leading to an abysmal effort all-around. It seems clear, however, that Marshall is no longer capable of occupying the No. 1 receiver role, and so needs Odell Beckham Jr. to return to have any value. If Beckham does play, he'll likely see Darius Slay, which should open the door to Marshall bouncing back in this one. But he's no more than a WR4 until he shows something."
45,Jordan Matthews,BUF,CAR,31,62,44.3,5.6,"Matthews managed to lead the Bills in receiving yards in Week 1's win over the Jets, but he only saw three targets. This week, he has a nice ceiling against the Panthers' secondary, but we can't reccomend starting anyone who might not see many targets."
46,Marqise Lee,JAC,TEN,22,57,45.5,6.1,"Allen Robinson is now out for the year with a torn ACL, and while Allen Hurns is still on the roster, he may actually be the #3 behind Keelan Cole. Lee is the clear beneficiary here and could now see in excess of 120 targets this season. Granted, it will be from Blake Bortles, but that type of volume is difficult to find."
47,Eric Decker,TEN,JAC,34,71,47.2,6.1,"Last week, Eric Decker was banged up, but still saw 8 targets. The Titans went away from running as much as we saw from them last season, which may be a sign of things to come, as they added Decker and Davis this offseason. Even against a tough Jaguars defense, Decker is a startable wide receiver in 12 team leagues."
48,Kenny Golladay,DET,NYG,29,75,49.2,7.2,"There was already plenty of hype on Golladay heading into the season and after he hauled in 2 touchdowns, it will go through the roof. Some will be hankering for him to be the top pickup of the week, but he only had four receptions and is still the obvious #3 in the depth chart behind Golden Tate and Marvin Jones. They also should be able to utilize Eric Ebron, Theo Riddick and Ameer Abdullah quite a bit as well so don't expect another 15 points any time soon."
49,Sterling Shepard,NYG,DET,30,69,49.4,7.0,"Shepard was one of the lone bright spots on Sunday against the Cowboys, catching seven of eight targets for 44 yards, and gaining six more on one rushing attempt. If Odell Beckham Jr. plays, he'll likely be guarded by Darius Slay, leaving plenty of soft spots in the defense for both Shepard and Brandon Marshall. For now, consider Shepard a WR4, but his solid effort in an otherwise disastrous Week 1 for the Giants should put him on your radar."
50,Nelson Agholor,PHI,KC,37,72,51.3,6.4,"Agholor had the big 58 yard touchdown reception, but even beyond that, he caught another 5 balls for 28 yards while leading the team in targets. Granted, the Eagles won't be playing a pass defense as bad as the Redskins' every week, but it is clear that they intend on using him enough to warrant a depth pickup in deeper leagues."
51,J.J. Nelson,ARI,IND,25,79,52.7,11.0,"John Brown led the team in targets during Week 1, but it was Nelson who has the lone touchdown along with 43 yards on 5 catches. Now that David Johnson is out for a while, Nelson could see even more targets and was already a useful fantasy piece prior to the injury."
52,Kendall Wright,CHI,TB,38,65,51.8,6.0,"With Cam Meredith and now Kevin White gone, Wright is the sure-fire top dog in the receiving core. Granted, that doesn't make Wright a must start every week, or even any week, but he does have some upside and is well worth owning moving forward as a depth piece."
53,Allen Hurns,JAC,TEN,26,72,51.7,7.7,"Many people are going to be tripping over themselves to add Hurns after Allen Robinson went down and Hurns led the team in targets, yards and receptions, but the matter of the fact is that he is 3rd on the depth chart behind Marqise Lee and Keelan Cole. Perhaps Hurns will play himself into more work, but until he does, don't go splurging your FAAB on him."
54,Mohamed Sanu,ATL,GB,16,75,52.5,10.4
55,Marvin Jones,DET,NYG,34,73,54.7,6.1,"Jones played in every passing down snap last week against the Cardinals, and was largely shadowed by Patrick Peterson. Although he was limited to just two catches and 37 yards, he did score a touchdown. Jones and company draw another tough matchup, as the Giants secondary is one of the best in the game. Janoris Jenkins should be matched up against Jones often, and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie is no slouch, either. With the tough matchup, Jones makes a WR4, at best. "
56,Paul Richardson,SEA,SF,38,83,54.7,7.8,Richardson continued his run from late last season and in the playoffs with a strong week 1 performance. He led the Seahawks in targets with 7 and hauled in 4 passes for 59 yards. The former 2nd round pick out of Colorado has the athletic profile to be a weapon for Russell Wilson now that he is getting consistent time on the field.
57,Kenny Britt,CLE,BAL,39,75,55.7,6.3,"Britt had just 3 targets last week to Coleman's 6 and that was against a middle of the road secondary. This week, they travel to Baltimore, who's defense is excellent. Britt shouldn't be started unless you are in a deep league or deseperate."
58,Cole Beasley,DAL,DEN,35,72,56.1,6.6,"Beasley saw just 5 targets, which was good for fourth on the team behind Witten, Dez Bryant and Terrance Williams. Still, he is a good bet to see a handful of targets each week so if you need a safe flex play add, you could do much worse than Beasley."
59,Robby Anderson,NYJ,OAK,41,83,56.5,6.0,"Kearse did lead the team in targets and may once again in Sunday afternoon's expected blowout against the Raiders, but Anderson's skill set works better, as the Raiders are vulnerable to the deep ball, which is his specialty. He can be used in the flex, but isn't a must-start by any means."
60,Donte Moncrief,IND,ARI,45,76,57.8,6.3,"The Colts were abysmal on all fronts last week, but their passing game essentially disappeared without Andrew Luck. Brisset is unlikely to make that any better, especially against the Cardinals defense, so it is advised that you bench Moncrief for Week 2."
61,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,OAK,44,71,58.0,5.6,"The Jets' offense was a mess even against a deflated Bills defense. With that said, Kearse somehow stepped right into the offense to lead the team with 9 targets, 7 receptions and 59 yards. He isn't going to be a Quincy Enunwa type of breakout, but he could have the same affect on your fantasy team as Kamar Aiken two seasons ago as a reliable flex play."
62,Zay Jones,BUF,CAR,47,85,59.8,5.6
63,Taylor Gabriel,ATL,GB,48,81,62.4,6.7
64,Tyler Lockett,SEA,SF,50,82,64.5,5.6,"Lockett had just two targets and caught one pass for eight yards in the opener against the Packers, but he can't take too much of the blame. Lockett was limited all preseason with injury, and played just more than half the snaps in the opener. Pete Carroll said he expects Lockett to get more time on offense this week against the 49ers, which is obviously a good thing for Lockett in a soft matchup. With Paul Richardson's emergence, it's unclear whether Lockett will continue to occupy the No. 2 role for the Seahawks. For now, Lockett should probably be kept on fantasy benches until everything is sorted out."
65,Jaron Brown,ARI,IND,45,103,74.8,13.5

77,Ryan Grant,WAS,LAR,58,120,83.3,10.3
78,Marquise Goodwin,SF,SEA,57,83,71.4,4.5,"Goodwin wasn't particularly impressive in Week 1,  catching just 3 balls on 6 targets for 21 yards. He did start, however, and should continue to see enough targets in these negative game scripts to justify adding him if you lost Kevin White or Allen Robinson."
79,Seth Roberts,OAK,NYJ,57,111,80.5,9.9

85,Terrance Williams,DAL,DEN,64,99,77.5,9.1,"Willams caught 6 of 7 targets for a team leading 68 yards in Week 1, but it was primarily because Janoris Jenkins was shadowing Dez. Most weeks, Dez will be the target monster. Still, Williams is a playmaker in the red zone and has week to week touchdown upside."

We know he's got some big play ability, and while he may not be on the field much quite yet, any 3rd or 4th fiddle in a Tom Brady offense is worth keeping an eye on."
