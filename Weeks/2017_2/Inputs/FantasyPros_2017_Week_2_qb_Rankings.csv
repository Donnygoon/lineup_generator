Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Aaron Rodgers,GB,ATL,1,4,1.6,0.7,"Rodgers is coming off a ""down"" game for him, throwing just one touchdown pass and an interception. But 311 yards passing and 21 yards rushing against a ferocious Seattle defense are nothing to sneeze at. Rodgers now gets a Falcons defense that allowed Mike Glennon to complete 65 percent of his pass attempts last week. Rodgers faced the Falcons twice in Atlanta last season (once in the postseason), and threw for seven touchdowns and just one interception. As he almost always is, Rodgers is a top option at quarterback this week. "
2,Tom Brady,NE,NO,1,6,1.9,1.0,"Every single relevant factor that could go Brady's way does go his way. He is excellent in domes. He is excellent against the Saints, when he has more than 6 days off and after a loss. The over under on this game is massive and for good reason. He is one of the top plays of the year this week."
3,Matt Ryan,ATL,GB,1,7,3.6,1.1,"Ryan looked just fine in Week 1 without Kyle Shanahan, completing 70 percent of his passes and throwing for 321 yards against the Bears. He'll now take on a Green Bay defense at home against whom he threw seven touchdown passes and no interceptions in two matchups last season. The Packers defense looked stout against the Seahawks, but that likely had as much to do with Seattle's terrible offensive line. Ryan is a full go in this one, and is easily a top-five option."
4,Drew Brees,NO,NE,2,8,3.7,1.2,"Brees wasn't spectacular on the road on Monday night against the Vikings, but he was certainly solid enough, completing 73 percent of his pass attempts and throwing a touchdown. He'll now get a Patriots defense that made Alex Smith look like a superstar. The Patriots will be rested, and you can be sure that Bill Belichick will have a few tricks up his sleeve. But Brees is an automatic top option at home, and this week is certainly no different in what looks to be a solid matchup."
5,Russell Wilson,SEA,SF,2,11,5.4,1.4,"As was the case for most of 2016, Wilson was running for his life once the ball was snapped, as defenders were in his face before he even had a chance to breathe. Seattle largely ignored its offensive line in the offseason, and Wilson paid the price on Sunday against the Packers, getting harassed all day. He gets a soft matchup in Week 2 at home against San Francisco, as the 49ers do little to scare opposing quarterbacks and allowed Cam Newton to throw two touchdown passes in Week 1. Wilson should rebound here, but he's far from the safest option right now with the Seahawks' terrible offensive line. "
6,Derek Carr,OAK,NYJ,2,11,5.9,1.5,"Oakland is tied for the second highest implied total on the week. The Jets are lousy on pass coverage and run defense, but the game script suggests they will spend most of the second half running the ball so unless the Jets manage to keep it close, his ceiling is capped at 3 TDs."
7,Jameis Winston,TB,CHI,4,14,7.8,1.7,"Winston finally gets to start his 2017 season, after Hurricane Irma postponed the Bucs' Week 1 game against the Dolphins. Winston instead opens against a Bears defense that didn't pose any problem for Matt Ryan and company. Winston improved in nearly every passing category last season, and the Bucs added DeSean Jackson and O.J. Howard into the fold. Obviously well-rested and with a home opener, expect Winston to shine in this one. "
8,Cam Newton,CAR,BUF,5,17,9.0,2.4,"Newton was far from dominant in Week 1 against the 49ers, but some rust was expected after he missed most of the preseason rehabbing his shoulder. He still threw for two touchdowns, however, and looked comfortable in the pocket. It's impossible to judge the Bills defense, as they took on a Jets team that has absolutely nothing offensively in Week 1. But with a brand new secondary that is still learning to communicate, the Bills should not present a formidable challenge, making Newton a start in this one. "
9,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,MIN,4,15,9.1,2.2,"We all know that Big Ben has been out of this world in home games over the past few years, but we are talking about what may be the best defense in all of football. They only allowed over 280 passing yards just once last season, so Big Ben's ceiling is limited."
10,Philip Rivers,LAC,MIA,5,19,9.7,2.5,"Philip Rivers will be throwing at a defense that allowed 19 passing touchdowns in their last eight games of 2016, which included matchups with Jared Goff, Colin Kaepernick, and Bryce Petty. There were just six quarterbacks who threw more than 34 pass attempts against them last year, but there were just four quarterbacks from Week 7-17 who didn't score at least 20.0 DraftKings points against them. They'll also be missing their best safety T.J. McDonald, who is out until Week 9. "
11,Carson Palmer,ARI,IND,6,24,11.9,2.8
12,Marcus Mariota,TEN,JAC,7,21,11.9,2.2,"Jacksonville destroyed the Texans last week, but Tennessee's offensive line might be twice as good as Houston's. They should be able to protect Mariota, allowing him time to find one of his many weapons, but Jacksonville has a strong enough secondary too that Mariota isn't quite startable."
13,Kirk Cousins,WAS,LAR,6,20,12.6,2.6,"Cousins started off on the wrong foot on Sunday against the Eagles, completing just 57.5 percent of his passes and throwing an interception while also losing two fumbles. He'll now take on a Rams defense that was incredibly impressive in Week 1, albeit against Scott Tolzien and an awful Colts offense. Sean McVay undoubtedly knows Cousins' tendencies well from his time in Washington, so the Rams may have something special in store for the quarterback. He makes a somewhat risky play here, but not one that you automatically need to avoid."
14,Matthew Stafford,DET,NYG,9,21,14.3,2.4,"Stafford dismantled a strong Arizona defense in Week 1, throwing for 292 yards and four touchdowns. He'll now get an angry Giants defense in its home opener on Monday Night Football, a daunting task for any quarterback. But it certainly appears that Stafford has evolved into an elite quarterback under Jim Bob Cooter's system, and that his decline in production in the second half of last year was simply due to his finger injury. If Stafford can pick apart the Arizona defense, than the Giants certainly shouldn't scare his owners. Still, he's just a low-end here, with better days likely ahead."
15,Alex Smith,KC,PHI,7,25,15.2,3.2,"Alex Smith was exceptional against a quality defense in Week 1. He is competiting for his career with Patrick Mahomes breathing right down his neck, so it isn't crazy to think he could keep it up. With that said, the best streamer option of the week will almost always be a better bet than Alex Smith."
16,Carson Wentz,PHI,KC,11,25,17.9,3.0,"Wentz had an excellent 2017 debut against the Redskins, throwing for more than 300 yards and two touchdowns. But he and the Eagles now travel to Kansas City to face a rested Chiefs team in Arrowhead Stadium, a notoriously difficult venue for opposing teams. The Chiefs lost Eric Berry for the season, which should open up room for Zach Ertz to make some plays, but their pass rush, combined with the imposing venue, makes Wentz a risky play here."
17,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,CAR,11,26,18.2,2.9,"Tyrod will be a start-worthy quarterback more weeks than not, but traveling to Carolina is a tough one. The Panthers took a major step backward in pass defense last season, but Tyrod gets a lot of his fantasy production on the ground, where the Panthers are stellar."
18,Sam Bradford,MIN,PIT,10,26,18.7,3.6,"Bradford looked like a new man in the opener against the Saints, completing 27 of 32 passes for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the victory over the Saints. Whether he's truly evolved into a new version of himself remains to be seen, but regardless, he'll have a tough test in Week 2 against the Steelers in Pittsburgh in Week 2. The Steelers recorded seven sacks last week against a decent Browns offensive line, and it remains to be seen whether the Vikings rebuilt protection can hold up against a pumped up front seven playing in front of a raucous crowd. But Bradford's outstanding opening game raised some eyebrows, making him a solid QB2 play despite the rough matchup."
19,Eli Manning,NYG,DET,14,26,18.5,2.7,"Other than a solid completion percentage, Manning had an awful opening game against Dallas, throwing for just 220 yards and an interception. While much of the blame can be placed on the offensive line, Odell Beckham Jr.'s absence certainly played a large role. Beckham should be back for this week's game against the Lions, which should open things up for the Giants' passing game. The Lions harassed Carson Palmer in Week 1, and Manning will undoubtedly have to deal with pressure. But at home in a nationally-televised game and with Beckham likely to return, Manning should fare better, making him a high-risk, potentially high-reward option this week."
20,Dak Prescott,DAL,DEN,12,26,19.7,3.0,"Prescott didn't have a huge fantasy game in Week 1, but he didn't need to, with the Cowboys totally dominating the Giants. Still, his 268 yards passing, 24 yards rushing, and one touchdown pass, showed that he should still be a viable start in most matchups. Unfortunately, he faces one of the best secondaries in the league this week in Denver, which almost always portends rough things for an opposing quarterback. The Broncos are a bit more vulnerable against the run than the pass, so expect the Cowboys to lean on Ezekiel Elliott heavily in this one. Prescott rarely has a total dud, but he certainly isn't a solid QB1 play this week. "
21,Joe Flacco,BAL,CLE,12,26,20.0,3.0,"Flacco only threw 17 passes last week because he is recovering from his back issue. Last season, he threw at least 30 in every single game, so he should be back to that soon, but there is no reason to assume it will be this week in a positive game script so we advise benching him until next week."
22,Jay Cutler,MIA,LAC,13,31,22.8,3.6,"If you've ever seen Jay Cutler under duress, you understand why he's a sit for this game. The Chargers front-seven that includes Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram is going to work the Dolphins lackluster offensive line and put Cutler on his back an awful lot. The Chargers also have cornerbacks to handle DeVante Parker and Kenny Stills, so Cutler would be wise to target Jarvis Landry a lot in this game. If he doesn't, it'll be a long day. "
23,Andy Dalton,CIN,HOU,14,28,21.9,2.6,"Dalton was lousy in Week 1 and while he will be startable again soon, it isn't this week against the Texans, even with Cushing out and several others banged up. This Bengals offensive line just won't be able to hold off Watt and Clowney."
24,Jared Goff,LAR,WAS,14,28,22.4,2.9
25,Trevor Siemian,DEN,DAL,12,30,23.3,3.0,"Believe it or not, Siemian was a top 5 quarterback last week, and for the 3rd time in his last 13 games. He has some big performances in him and one may be at home against a Dallas secondary that struggled all last season. If you want a lottery ticket this week, Siemian is your guy."
26,Blake Bortles,JAC,TEN,16,31,25.2,3.1,"Bortles has now thrown 98 consecutive passes without an interception. If you are desperate for a quarterback, perhaps in Andrew Luck's stead, Bortles is quite reliable for this week against a Titans secondary with plenty of issues themselves."
27,Jacoby Brissett,IND,ARI,20,33,29.7,2.2
28,DeShone Kizer,CLE,BAL,21,31,27.0,1.7
29,Deshaun Watson,HOU,CIN,22,32,27.8,1.9,"While Watson does offer some upside because of his legs, the offensive line in Houston looked abysmal, plus Watson is dealing with a sprained ankle and may miss a few games in order to get to 100%. Even if he were healthy, he isn't yet worth owning outside of a 2QB league."
