Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Seattle Seahawks,SEA,SF,1,5,1.4,0.8,"Considering the matchup, fantasy owners couldn't have been too disappointed with the effort of the Seahawks DST in the opener against the Packers. The defense held Aaron Rodgers and company to just 17 points and recorded four sacks and an interception. Things should get much better this week, as they return home to take on a 49ers team that put up just three points last week and has Brian Hoyer at the helm. Expect a bevy of sacks and turnovers, but few points allowed."
2,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,IND,1,14,2.7,1.8,"Matthew Stafford largely had his way against the Cardinals defense in Week 1, throwing four touchdown passes. But the Arizona DST still made a fantasy impact, with a sack and a Justin Bethel pick-six. They now get a dream matchup against the Colts, though it's a bit less appetizing now that Jacoby Brissett, and not Scott Tolzien, will be starting at quarterback. Still, Brissett has only been with the team for a few weeks, and didn't light the world on fire in his brief time with the Patriots last season. Expect the Cardinals DST to be one of the best units in fantasy this week."
3,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,CLE,1,16,3.6,2.5,"Just one week after shutting out their divisional rival, the Ravens will return home to play against the DeShone Kizer led Browns. While Kizer held his own in his rookie debut, he did hold onto the ball an awful lot and was sacked seven times on just 41 dropbacks. The Ravens sacked Andy Dalton five times on just 36 dropbacks. Things could get ugly for the rookie against a veteran defense. "
4,Oakland Raiders,OAK,NYJ,1,18,4.8,2.5,"This will be a matchup to target all year in both season-long and DFS, as the Jets are never going to project to score more than two touchdowns. On top of that, Josh McCown doesn't have the athletic ability to get away from the Raiders pass rush led by Khalil Mack. They are like the Rams defense from last week. "
5,Carolina Panthers,CAR,BUF,1,30,7.1,3.5
6,Houston Texans,HOU,CIN,1,32,7.2,5.5,"The Bengals were shut out last week by a Ravens defense that is inferior to the Texans' unit. Houston could do similar things with multiple turnovers, a handful of sacks against this abysmal offensive line, and limit the points to 14 or less."
7,Cincinnati Bengals,CIN,HOU,2,32,7.7,5.5,"We saw what Jacksonville did to Savage, Watson and especially the offensive line in Week 1 with just 7 points and 9 sacks allowed. Watson is starting this week, but for what it's worth, he was actually worse than Savage last week and is dealing with an ankle issue so the Bengals are a surefire start in Week 2."
8,Denver Broncos,DEN,DAL,2,23,10.3,4.3,"The loss of T.J. Ward loomed large on Monday night against the Chargers, as the Broncos allowed two passing scores, something they allowed an opposing quarterback do just one time last year. Dak Prescott is the real deal and will have Ezekiel Elliott on the field to do work. They don't have many games where they're a recommended sit, but this is one of them against a Cowboys team that can move the ball in a variety of ways. "
9,New York Giants,NYG,DET,4,20,10.6,3.0,"As is the fate of most DSTs, the Giants unit didn't do much against the Cowboys, registering just a single sack on Sunday night. Although Matthew Stafford put up a ton of points on the Cardinals in Week 1, the Giants defense should still have plenty of opportunities to make plays. Buoyed by a stellar secondary and solid pass rush, and in front of a likely raucous crowd for the home opener on Monday night, expect the Giants DST to register several sacks and a turnover or two, as they should rebound from Sunday night's clunker."
10,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,TEN,2,22,11.6,3.1
11,Los Angeles Chargers,LAC,MIA,3,25,11.8,3.8,"What does the Chargers defense do best? Cover perimeter wide receivers and get after the quarterback with a solid pass rush. What are the Dolphins lacking? The offensive line that will allow continual pressure on Jay Cutler, who folds under pressure. You should expect at least 3-4 sacks and a turnover or two in this game. "
12,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,PHI,3,19,11.6,3.1
13,Los Angeles Rams,LAR,WAS,5,26,12.2,3.8,"The Rams defense had a field day on Sunday against the hapless Colts, holding them to nine points and recording four sacks, two interceptions, a fumble recovery, and two touchdowns. While a lot of that can be placed at Scott Tolzien's feet, Wade Phillips' unit is legitimate. To add to their appeal, Aaron Donald should suit up for this one. The Redskins offense struggled mightily against the Eagles, and Kirk Cousins is prone to getting careless with the football. At home (albeit likely in front of a fairly meager crowd), the Rams DST should once again be one of the standout units of the week."
14,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,TB,CHI,1,22,11.8,4.1,"We haven't yet seen the 2017 version of the Tampa Bay defense, but judging by the second half of last year, fantasy owners should be in for a pleasant surprise on Sunday against the Bears. Between Gerald McCoy, Lavonte David, and Kwon Alexander, the Bucs have a ferocious defense, which accounted for 17 interceptions, 16 forced fumbles, and four touchdowns in 2016. On Sunday, they'll be playing in front of a pumped-up crowd in their opener against the a Mike Glennon-led offense. The Falcons sacked Glennon four times in Week 1, and you can bet the Bucs are going to beat that mark on Sunday. They Tampa Bay DST should be a solid play this week."
15,Pittsburgh Steelers,PIT,MIN,3,22,12.7,3.1
16,Tennessee Titans,TEN,JAC,6,26,15.2,3.3
17,Minnesota Vikings,MIN,PIT,5,29,16.5,3.7,"You don't want to play many defenses in fantasy when they visit Heinz Field, as Ben Roethlisberger posts tons of points. The Steelers also boast a top-five offensive line, which will in turn force the Vikings secondary to hang with Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant for longer than normal, which is a problem. It's best to find another option this week. "
18,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,KC,5,29,18.3,3.0
19,Washington Redskins,WAS,LAR,5,26,18.4,3.7
20,Dallas Cowboys,DAL,DEN,6,28,19.1,3.4
