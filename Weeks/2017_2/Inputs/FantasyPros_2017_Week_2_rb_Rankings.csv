Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev
1,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,MIN,1,4,1.4,0.8,"Bell struggled in Week 1 against an inferior Browns' defense but part of that should have been expected, as he didn't get work in the preseason because of his holdout. This week, he shouldn't end up the top running back because of the matchup against the Vikings, but he is still a high-end RB1."
2,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,DEN,1,6,2.5,1.3,"Elliott had a pretty typical game in Week 1, rushing for 104 yards on 24 carries and catching five passes for 36 yards against a tough Giants defense. He'll now get another difficult test against the Broncos in Denver. While an undoubtedly stiff matchup, the Broncos' real strength is against the pass, and the Cowboys are likely to lean heavily on Elliott and their run game in an effort to control the clock and grind out a victory. Despite the tough opponent, Elliott is, and will almost always be regardless of the matchup, a top option at running back this week."
3,Melvin Gordon,LAC,MIA,1,8,3.5,1.6,"Gordon showed flashes of brilliance in Week 1, but was shut down by the Broncos after the first quarter. He has some upside, as with most weeks, but the Dolphins do have a stout run defense led by Suh, so his floor is lower than most RB1s."
4,LeSean McCoy,BUF,CAR,1,20,5.1,3.2,"The Panthers defense took a major step backward last season, but that was almost entirely because of the secondary woes. They still shut down the run and should again this season. The Bills do have a top notch offensive line, but McCoy will likely be worse than his usual self this week."
5,Kareem Hunt,KC,PHI,3,14,6.6,2.4,"After a huge Week 1, plenty are wondering if Hunt is the real deal. He is. What we saw last week was against what should be a strong run defense. He draws another one this week. Don't plan on another 40+ points, but he should be a top 12 RB."
6,Devonta Freeman,ATL,GB,1,13,7.0,2.6,"Freeman had a touchdown in the opener against the Bears, but it was from an overly encouraging 2017 debut. He gained just 37 yards on 12 carries and had 10 receiving yards on two catches, with just 14 total touches to Tevin Coleman's 12. He'll now take on a Green Bay defense against which he struggled in 2016 (averaging just 3.1 yards per carry in two games). The good thing for Freeman is that he scored three touchdowns in the two games against the Packers in 2016, and his nose for the end zone almost always means that he'll be productive for fantasy owners. He makes a top-10 option here in the likely shootout."
7,Ty Montgomery,GB,ATL,1,18,7.8,3.0,"Montgomery didn't set the world on fire in Week 1 against the Seahawks (just 2.8 yards per carry), but his 93 total yards from scrimmage certainly helped fantasy owners. More notably, he played 74 of 82 snaps last week, showing that he is certainly the bell-cow back for the Packers. He'll now go against a Falcons defense that is notorious for its struggles against pass-catching backs and allowed Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen to combine for 179 total yards last week. Montgomery makes a top play in the likely shootout."
8,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,NYJ,2,16,8.4,3.5,"Let's be clear - Marshawn Lynch belongs in every fantasy lineup possible in Week 2. It will be his homecoming game to Oakland, and it's something he's extremely passionate about. What better way to say hello than to destroy a Sheldon Richardson-less Jets run defense that just allowed the combination of LeSean McCoy and Mike Tolbert to rack up 152 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries. Lynch didn't look slow or out of shape against the dominant Titans run defense last week, so I'd expect nothing less than 80-plus yards and a touchdown or two this week. LOCK. "
9,Jay Ajayi,MIA,LAC,3,15,8.8,3.0,"We haven't seen Ajayi in action yet because of the hurricane, but he should be a workhorse with little competition in the backfield for touches. The Chargers had the ball run on them 36 times last week by the Broncos, so don't be shocked if Ajayi leads the NFL in carries this week."
10,Leonard Fournette,JAC,TEN,2,15,9.1,3.0,"After an impressive debut, Fournette finds himself in a tough spot on a talent-deprived offense. The Texans were the perfect opponent for the Jaguars to impose their will on, but the Titans won't give them that gift. The Jaguars defense will allow Fournette to get 20-plus carries most weeks, but I'm concerned he doesn't against a Titans defense that has finished No. 6 and No. 2 over the last two years against fantasy running backs. "
11,Todd Gurley,LAR,WAS,4,19,11.0,3.4,"Gurley provided his owners with plenty of fantasy value in Week 1 against the Colts, though much of it came through the air (56 yards on five receptions). Despite the pillow-soft matchup, he averaged just 2.1 yards per carry in the game, hardly a number that quells fears about his lackluster 2016. He gets a Redskins team in Week 2 that held the Eagles running backs in check (just 58 yards on the ground), though it's hard to say whether that was because of the Washington defense or simply the lack of an effective Philadelphia ground game. Either way, Gurley is guaranteed to have a ton of volume, which puts him as a low-end RB1 in this game, but don't expect him to explode."
12,Dalvin Cook,MIN,PIT,7,26,11.5,3.2,"Cook dazzled in Week 1 against the Saints, rushing for 127 yards on 22 carries and catching three passes for 10 yards. Perhaps most importantly, he was in on 51 of 65 snaps, putting to rest any concerns of a timeshare. A Week 2 matchup against the Steelers in Pittsburgh is an entirely different story than a home matchup against the Saints, as the Steelers held the Browns to just a 2.3 yards per carry average in Week 1. Still, Cook is as talented as they come, and there's almost no way you can sit him here. Temper expectations a bit, but this game should provide a pretty realistic view of the Vikings' rebuilt offensive line and what we can expect from Cook this season."
13,DeMarco Murray,TEN,JAC,6,21,12.9,2.8,"Last week, Murray received 12 carries while Henry saw 6. That is about the split we can expect moving forward unless Murray is outperformed by Henry. The Jaguars defense, as we saw in Week 1 will pose quite a challenge, but Murray is no doubt a top 15 running back again this week."
14,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,BUF,6,24,14.5,3.3,"McCaffrey had a mixed NFL debut, gaining just 47 yards on 13 carries and catching five of seven targets for 38 yards, while losing a fumble. He was also out-touched by Jonathan Stewart. However, McCaffrey led he team in both targets and catches, showing that he has an incredibly high floor because of his involvement in the passing game. He'll take on a tougher test than the 49ers in Week 2 when the Panthers take on the Bills, but he still makes a decent RB2 play, particularly in PPR leagues. But with Ron RIvera's recent comments about not wanting to overdo it early in the season with McCaffrey, the young running back may have a capped ceiling for the early part of the season."
15,C.J. Anderson,DEN,DAL,10,26,16.3,3.2,"Anderson had the majority of the work in Week 1, but Jamaal Charles saw plenty of touches as well. This week, they go against last season's #1 run defense, and if Anderson is splitting the work again, he shouldn't be started against such a strong opponent."
16,Jordan Howard,CHI,TB,7,40,16.3,4.5,"Tarik Cohen's emergence is a little nerve-wracking for Howard's fantasy owners, but he's in no danger of losing his lead-back role just yet. Howard had a mediocre 2017 debut against the Falcons, gaining 52 yards on 13 carries and catching three of his five targets for just 14 yards. But he dropped a potential game-winning touchdown pass, which is disconcerting, as he led all NFL running backs in dropped passes last year with eight. The Bucs struggled to stop the run last season (117.2 rushing yards per game allowed), so there may be room for Howard to do some damage. But if the Bucs jump out far ahead, Howard may cede more work to Cohen."
17,Lamar Miller,HOU,CIN,6,26,17.5,4.1,"Houston's offensive line gave Miller nothing to work with last week against a stout Jaguars defense, and while they get less of a challenge this week, the Bengals are getting Burfict back in action. Miller's volume makes him a surefire start, but he is a mid-range RB2 in standard leagues."
18,Carlos Hyde,SF,SEA,12,39,21.2,4.9,"Hyde had a solid debut in Kyle Shanahan's offense, gaining 45 yards on nine carries and 32 yards on six receptions. Most encouraging for Hyde was his involvement in the passing game, particularly since he stayed so heavily involved despite the 49ers playing from behind all game. Unfortunately, he'll now go against an angry Seahawks team in Seattle, who will undoubtedly focus on limiting Hyde in light of San Francisco's lack of other weapons. Still, volume alone keeps Hyde as a startable option here, albeit more in the low-end RB2 or high-end RB3 range."
19,Mark Ingram,NO,NE,12,39,21.3,4.7,"Some will be scared to start Ingram after the Week 1 snap debacle between the three running backs, but if Sean Payton does anything, it's adjust to things that aren't working. Mark Ingram is the one running back on that team where game-script doesn't matter, as he carries the ball well and catches it out of the backfield, as evidenced by his five catches for 54 yards in Week 1. In a game that has the highest over/under of the week, you want as many parts of it as possible. "
20,Jacquizz Rodgers,TB,CHI,13,34,21.8,4.6,"Rodgers missed out on what should have been a solid matchup against the Dolphins thanks to Hurricane Irma, and will now open his season at home against the Bears. Chicago was relatively effective against the run in Week 1 against the Falcons, holding Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman to a combined 53 yards rushing and just 2.8 yards per carry. But the Bucs are obviously rested and should be ready to roll for their opener, and they've shown that they're not afraid to give Rodgers upwards of 25 carries in a game, particularly since he's just a short-term option with Doug Martin due back in a few weeks. Rodgers' volume makes him an RB2 play here, with the potential for more if he can find his way into the end zone."
21,Terrance West,BAL,CLE,8,38,21.9,5.7,"While Buck Allen may have led the team in carries, it was West who had the more important touches during the game, so he should be the favorite to see most of the work against Cleveland if the game remains even remoteley close. Any starting RB against the Browns is a fantasy starter each week."
22,Mike Gillislee,NE,NO,13,37,23.1,5.8,"The Saints allowed the third-most fantasy points to running backs last year and it wasn't because of yardage. They allowed 18 rushing touchdowns to running backs last year, which ranked as the second-most in the NFL. Coming off a home loss in Week 1 and a long week of practice to prepare, the Patriots are going to put a lot of points on the board against a Saints defense that just allowed Sam Bradford to look like Tom Brady. When the Patriots score points, Gillislee does, plain and simple. "
23,Tarik Cohen,CHI,TB,7,42,23.2,6.7,"The Bears' backup running back may actually pick up the targets Kevin White left when he went on season ending IR. Cohen was one of the top running backs in Week 1 with 8 receptions and 113 total yards with a score. Jordan Howards job appears safe for now, but Cohen is a serious playmaker."
24,James White,NE,NO,13,34,23.6,5.0,"White played more snaps than Mike Gillislee, Rex Burkhead, and Dion Lewis combined in Week 1, clearly showing why they extended him this offseason. He's going to be a big part of their offense every week and the matchup against the Saints is a great one. They allowed 868 yards and five touchdowns in the passing game to running backs last year, the second-most in the league, behind only Atlanta. With Julian Edelman out for the year and Danny Amendola potentially out for this game, White has a safe role on an unpredictable Patriots offense. "
25,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,BAL,15,42,23.9,4.6,"You already saw the struggles that Crowell will have at times, and the matchup with the Ravens isn't going to help. They allowed opposing running backs just 3.3 yards per carry at home last season, which is where this game will be played. Some will look at his game against them last year that produced a 18/133/1 stat line and think he'll be okay, but that was anchored by a 75-yard touchdown run where he was untouched. On his other 26 carries against them throughout last season, he totaled just 81 yards. He's nothing more than a low-upside RB2.  "
26,Bilal Powell,NYJ,OAK,11,41,24.4,5.1,"Powell is clearly the superior back to Matt Forte at this point in their careers, but the Jets insist on giving Forte the ball anyways. "
27,Tevin Coleman,ATL,GB,16,42,27.7,4.8,"Coleman didn't get much going on the ground against Chicago in Week 1, gaining only 16 yards on eight carries. But as usual, he made up for it in the air, hauling in four catches for 42 yards. Importantly, he essentially split time with Devonta Freeman, getting 12 touches to Freeman's 14. Coleman struggled on the ground in the playoff game against the Packers last year (just 29 yards rushing on 11 carries), but did score a touchdown and gained 35 yards through the air. Expect him to get plenty of work in a likely shootout this week, and even if he again struggles to find running room, he should find enough work in the passing game to make him a startable option."
28,Theo Riddick,DET,NYG,19,45,29.1,5.5,"Riddick scored a receiving touchdown in Week 1 against the Cardinals, but otherwise had a quiet day, with six receptions for just 27 yards. He'll likely have trouble finding the end zone in Week 2, as the Giants did not allow a single receiving touchdown to running backs all last season. His involvement in the passing game gives him a relatively high floor in PPR leagues, but even there, he's not more than a WR3 on Monday night."
29,Ameer Abdullah,DET,NYG,19,38,29.1,4.9,"Abdullah wasn't productive against the Cardinals, rushing for just 30 yards on 15 carries and catching three of his four targets for 11 yards. Dwayne Washington also saw a number of snaps in the red zone, a worrisome development for Abdullah owners. But Abdullah did see 18 touches in the game and, frankly, that is the number that matters most. If he sees a similar workload against a Giants defense - a tough matchup but not nearly as bad as Abdullah's Week 1 game against the Cardinals - he has a good chance at success from the volume alone. Consider him a flex play this week."
30,Javorius Allen,BAL,CLE,16,44,31.2,5.9,"I can't imagine anyone saw Buck getting 21 carries in Week 1, but with Danny Woodhead going out for a week or two with the hamstring injury, Allen filled in. He wasn't very good, mind you, but if the Ravens continue to run anywhere close to 42 times per game, Allen would definitley be worth owning."
31,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,BUF,20,45,31.4,4.2,"Stewart played a large role in the Panthers' Week 1 win over the 49ers, as he got 18 carries for 65 yards and hauled in two receptions for 17 yards and a touchdown. He was involved right from the beginning, splitting time with Christian McCaffrey, and was not purely a ""kill the clock"" back with the Panthers leading. Stewart's upside is obviously limited, both by his own lack of explosiveness and his splitting of time with McCaffrey. But he should get a fair amount of volume going forward, including in Week 2 against the Bills. Stewart averaged just 3.6 YPC against a weak 49ers defensive front, so he may not see much more success against a better, albeit not overly impressive, Bills front. But he makes a decent flex play and has a fine chance to score a touchdown."
32,Kerwynn Williams,ARI,IND,15,45,32.6,6.1,"David Johnson will be out for an estimated 12 weeks. Seeing that Kerwynn was the only other running back to see carries, it seems as though he will be the workhorse back in Johnson's stead. That doesn't mean he will see 20+ touches per game like Johnson, only that he won't have much competition. Still, a clear-cut starting running back is a commodity so he is one of the highest priority running backs of the week."
33,Darren Sproles,PHI,KC,20,56,33.6,6.1,"Sproles had a fairly typical game in the opener against Washington, garnering just two carries for two yards but catching all five of his targets for 43 yards. A matchup in Arrowhead Stadium is never a good thing for opposing offenses, but Sproles may find a bit of room here. The Chiefs gave up an average of 33 receiving yards to running backs in 2016, and allowed 30-plus receiving yards in seven of their last 10 games. In PPR leagues especially, Sproles makes a fine RB3 play, and should haul in five or more catches if things break as they should."
34,Alvin Kamara,NO,NE,14,50,34.6,7.4
35,Robert Kelley,WAS,LAR,24,65,37.4,7.6,"The Rams are getting Aaron Donald back this week, which is bad news for Kelley. Not that it mattered much, as he's struggled quite a bit since taking over the starting job. Over his last seven starts, he's topped 3.9 yards per carry just twice. While Samaje Perine didn't play an offensive snap in Week 1, he's going to get opportunities if Kelley continues playing like he has. "
36,Shane Vereen,NYG,DET,17,60,37.8,7.2,"Vereen led the team in both targets (10) and receptions (nine) in Week 1 against the Cowboys, which says more about their ineptitude on offense than it does about Vereen's talent. His value against the Lions turns on whether Odell Beckham Jr. plays. If he does, then Vereen's targets and usage will undoubtedly fall significantly. If he does not, then Vereen should see more than half the snaps, as he did in Week 1, and see enough work to be an RB3 in PPR leagues."
37,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,KC,23,51,37.9,6.7,"Blount had a very ""Blountesque"" game in Week 1 against the Redskins, gaining 46 yards on 14 carries (3.28 YPC) and scoring a touchdown, albeit on a reception. He was clearly the lead dog in Philadelphia, and is the obvious choice on the goal line. His upside is generally limited, but his nose for the end zone and opportunity usually make him a flex option. This week, he'll take on a very tough Chiefs defense in Kansas City, one of the toughest venues for opposing teams. His high usage keeps him as a low-end flex play in standard leagues, but not much more."
38,Frank Gore,IND,ARI,23,49,38.4,5.7,"We all knew the end would come at some point and it seems to have come sooner than any of us realized. Gore toted the ball 10 times against the Aaron Donald-less Rams and mustered up 42 yards before the Colts decided that Marlon Mack should see more playing time. The Cardinals actually played really good run defense in Week 1, despite losing Calais Campbell this offseason and held Ameer Abdullah to just 30 yards on 15 carries. Gore isn't going to do much in this game. "
39,Chris Thompson,WAS,LAR,26,89,40.1,9.2,"The Redskins' third down back is by no means a league winner or an every week start, but if you ever need a flex play, especially in PPR, he will do the trick. The Redskins expect to use him in the passing game consistently just as they did successfully to close the 2016 season."
40,Joe Mixon,CIN,HOU,23,51,38.9,5.3,"Prior to the season starting, I warned you that this would be a timeshare to avoid, and here we are. Despite Jeremy Hill playing just 10 snaps, Mixon didn't do anything with his opportunity in Week 1, totaling just nine yards on eight carries. In fact, Giovani Bernard played the most snaps and scored the most fantasy points. The Texans are out for blood and the Bengals offensive line doesn't have the talent to stop them. If Mixon does anything, it'll be in the passing game. "
41,Duke Johnson,CLE,BAL,22,54,40.1,7.6,"If you are desperate, you could pick up Johnson in a pinch, who isn't a great play, but has a nice safe floor with a handful of carries and targets expected each week regardless of the game script."
42,Thomas Rawls,SEA,SF,24,80,41.4,8.1,"Rawls looks ready to return at full strength after missing Week 1's game against the Packers with a high ankle sprain, and he could hardly be walking into a better situation. Yes, the offensive line once again looked abysmal in the opener, but it became apparent quickly that this is not Eddie Lacy's backfield. Chris Carson has potential and C.J. Prosise will factor in on passing downs, but Rawls should likely get a chance to start and run away with the lead role. And that's a good thing, considering the Seahawks match up against a 49ers team that had an historically awful run defense in 2017, surrendering 165.9 rushing yards per game. While it's unlikely to be that bad, Rawls should have plenty of room to run, though the uncertainty of the situation keeps him as an RB3."
43,Paul Perkins,NYG,DET,25,57,41.2,6.4,"Until we see the Giants ride Perkins throughout a full game, it's going to be difficult to trust him. There were just two running backs who were able to top 18 PPR points against the Lions defense last year, and they haven't allowed a running back to top 86 rushing yards since way back in Week 4 of last year. "
44,Andre Ellington,ARI,IND,22,59,43.6,7.3
45,Matt Forte,NYJ,OAK,29,57,43.3,5.1,"Forte is cutting into Bilal Powell's work, but if he was going to do anything substantial, last week would have been the week. Unless Powell goes down with an injury, Forte isn't startable in standard leagues."
46,Giovani Bernard,CIN,HOU,30,58,43.1,5.2,"Bernard did lead the Bengals backfield in Week 1, but this entire three-headed monster is a disaster worth avoiding, especially this week against the Texans defense. Bernard will have flex appeal plenty of other weeks, however."
47,Chris Carson,SEA,SF,28,69,44.9,6.7,"Eddie Lacy and Carson split carries with Thomas Rawls out, and while Rawls may be back shortly, Carson clearly outplayed Lacy just as he did all pre-season. There is good reason to believe Carson continues to see touches, plus he has the upside to take over the job all for himself."
48,Adrian Peterson,NO,NE,29,84,48.9,8.5
49,Charles Sims,TB,CHI,35,59,47.9,5.6
50,Rex Burkhead,NE,NO,29,62,49.9,6.9,"Burkhead is the one RB down here with a lofty ceiling. If the Patriots stick him at the slot, he could go off and has big play ability. Still, it isn't advised that you start him unless ther is a late scratch to one of your players."
51,Jamaal Charles,DEN,DAL,40,64,51.1,4.7,"Charles didn't see many snaps in Week 1, but when he was on the field, they got the ball in his hands. That could continue to increase as the season goes on, but at this point, he isn't startable, especially when you consider that his opponent this week had the best run defense in football in 2016."
52,Jeremy Hill,CIN,HOU,25,66,52.9,7.1
53,Derrick Henry,TEN,JAC,38,68,51.1,4.7,"Henry only saw 6 carries last week and shouldn't see more unless Murray goes down with an injury. While he is well worth keeping, he isn't startable until that narrative changes."
54,Marlon Mack,IND,ARI,38,64,52.4,5.2,"The Colts trusted Mack with plenty of snaps, as he was on the field only two plays less than Frank Gore. Seeing that Gore was lousy once again and that Mack has shown a spark of excitement this preseason, he is worth adding on the mere chance that he takes over the job in the coming weeks and never looks back. When Andrew Luck gets back on the field, Mack could be a game changer for fantasy teams."
55,C.J. Prosise,SEA,SF,35,66,54.6,6.0
56,Tyler Ervin,HOU,CIN,32,74,58.0,10.6
57,Mike Tolbert,BUF,CAR,39,68,57.7,6.6,"If McCoy's groin concern turns into anything substantial, it would be Tolbert who would assume the head dog role and without question, the goal-line work. He can be picked up if you need RB depth."
58,Chris Johnson,ARI,IND,36,83,63.7,10.2,"There is speculation growing that the Cardinals will sign Chris Johnson once again now that David Johnson is shelved. With that said, he won't automatically be given the starting role, as Kerwynn Williams was the backup running back to DJ for a reason. Johnson is only a lottery ticket at this point."
59,Jalen Richard,OAK,NYJ,38,75,60.5,7.8
60,Eddie Lacy,SEA,SF,40,82,64.6,9.0
61,DeAndre Washington,OAK,NYJ,46,69,58.8,5.2
62,Samaje Perine,WAS,LAR,41,101,73.0,12.3,"Perine didn't get a single touch or target, playing only on special teams. For the way Robert Kelley played, however, and how talented we know Perine to be, we can expect that narrative to change within the week. It should only be a matter of time before Perine is the head honcho in this backfield."
