Granted, the weather in the Bay Area was miserable for that game, with steady rain and some wind, but Jimmy G has committed six turnovers in his last three games. First-round rookie Trey Lance is recovering from a sprained knee, but his return is imminent. If he's active this week after being inactive in Week 7, Garoppolo is at risk of an in-game benching if things go sideways for him against the Bears. Even if Garoppolo plays all 60 minutes, this game doesn't exactly set up as a fantasy bonanza for him. The 49ers and Bears are both among the 10 slowest-paced teams in the league. The Bears have a run-funnel defense, with opponents running the ball against them on 45% of their offensive plays. Chicago is giving up 18.0 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks, tied for the 10th-lowest figure in the league.

He's looked good at times when he's had a clean pocket, but he's been a train wreck when under pressure, and he's been under pressure quite a bit. The Bears have allowed a league-high 26 sacks. Some of those are Watson's fault, sure, but all too often the pressure has been overwhelming. That was the case against the Buccaneers in Week 7 when injuries and a COVID-19 case forced the Bears to start Lachavious Simmons, whom they'd just activated from the practice squad, at right tackle and have him try to block either Shaquil Barrett or Jason Pierre-Paul, often without help from a running back or tight end. The results were predictably ugly. The Bears' opponents this week, the 49ers, have recorded 12 sacks and haven't been able to generate the sort of pass rush they have in the recent past, but the Bears have a way of making opposing pass rushers look good.
