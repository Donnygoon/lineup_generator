Anderson's average depth of target in his final two seasons with the Jets hovered around 15 yards. Last year, his aDOT was 9.7 yards. Life as a short-area receiver suited him.

Bateman's a sure-handed receiver that's going to be able to operate underneath and help move the chains. He has the potential to make an impact for fantasy football down the line, but it's unlikely to happen here right out of the gate. We should pick up Bateman in our fantasy football leagues if we have the space on our bench, but we can't trust him in our starting lineups just yet.",,,WR69,F,6.8,2.072271698113208

However, he only played nine total snaps in week five against the Bills. There's a possibility that Gordon develops into more of a focal point for the Chiefs offense as the season progresses, but that's not a guarantee. Even further from a guarantee is the possibility that Gordon turns into a viable weekly starter for fantasy lineups at any point this season. If you have Gordon on your roster and you need someone who is actually contributing right now, you can drop him onto your waiver wire.
