He's on the road against a Denver defense that's allowing an average of 207 passing yards and one TD pass per game. The Jon Gruden scandal led to an abrupt coaching change and brought unwanted attention to the Raiders' organization, so who knows what sort of mood the team will be in for a tough road game against a division rival. Plus, Carr has lost momentum after a hot start. He averaged 401 passing yards and threw six TD passes over his first three games. He's averaged 201 passing yards and has thrown two TD passes over his last two games. Carr checks in at QB16 this week, buoyed mainly by robust passing volume.

As bad as Roethlisberger has looked at times this season, it's hard to generate much enthusiasm for him. But if you're going to throw him into your lineup, it should be in a spot like this, with a home date against a bad defense.

It wouldn't be a complete shock if Fields wound up having a big game against a Green Bay pass defense that's missing stud CB Jaire Alexander and top edge rusher Za'Darius Smith.

While we can't view him as a trustworthy start in 1QB leagues in his first game back, he's absolutely in the Superflex conversation due to the matchup. The Jaguars are allowing nearly 300 passing yards per game and 1.4 passing touchdowns on average to opposing QBs this season.
