Through Week 14, Patterson was averaging 15.8 fantasy points per game (0.5 PPR) to rank RB10 in that category. Over the last two weeks, he's averaged 5.6 fantasy points. A two-game sample size is small, of course, but the change in Patterson's usage dates back further. Patterson simply hasn't been used much as a pass catcher since the start of November. Over his first eight games, he averaged 5.9 targets, 4.8 receptions and 57.4 receiving yards. In the six games since, Patterson has averaged 3.2 targets, 1.8 receptions and 10.7 receiving yards. He's being used almost exclusively as a runner, and he's not even running that often. Over the last two weeks, Patterson has 18 carries on 62 offensive snaps. Falcons RB Mike Davis has played more snaps than Patterson in four of Atlanta's last five games. Once a slam-dunk weekly RB1, Patterson is now merely a low-end RB with a rickety floor.",start,,WR78,C-,6.4,23.88015
