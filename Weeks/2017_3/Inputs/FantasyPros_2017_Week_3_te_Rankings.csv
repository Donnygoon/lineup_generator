Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Travis Kelce,KC,LAC,1,4,2.0,0.6,Kelce is the last healthy good tight end. He is almost the best play by default. He is also coming off a killer game and gets a decent matchup so expect more big things from him in Week 3.
2,Rob Gronkowski,NE,HOU,1,6,2.1,1.6,"Gronk is dealing with a groin injury, which is why he missed the final third of the game. Owners shouldn't be worried, however, as he would have played if the game wasn't already in hand. He ought to be started even with the injury and the tough matchup."
3,Zach Ertz,PHI,NYG,1,5,2.6,0.9,"Ertz has quickly developed into one of the best tight ends in all of fantasy, despite the fact that he rarely scores touchdowns. His 13 receptions this season leads the Eagles, and he's already racked up 190 yards receiving. He now gets to go against a Giants defense that excels at limiting wide receivers but struggles against the tight end position, as they allowed the fourth-most yards to the position last year and gave up a touchdown to Eric Ebron last week. Ertz is a top option in both standard and PPR leagues in Week 3, without question."
4,Delanie Walker,TEN,SEA,3,13,5.6,2.0,"Walker looked incredible last week against a Jaguars team who has done well at defending the tight end over it's last 10 games. He even ran the ball in for a score and didn't look like an old man doing so. Seattle may have a great defense, but they have struggled against tight ends over the past three seasons."
5,Martellus Bennett,GB,CIN,3,17,6.7,2.8,"Bennett has had a disappointing start to his Green Bay career, totaling only 90 yards and failing to score a touchdown. But he's seen 17 targets and a 17 percent target share. With Randall Cobb doubtful, Bennett should continue to see a ton of targets in Week 3 against the Bengals, and that should mean good things. The Bengals are still without Vontaze Burfict and allowed an average of 72 yards receiving to opposing tight ends last season. Bennett has as much upside as any tight end in this one, and makes a rock-solid TE1, despite his lack of production so far in 2017."
6,Jason Witten,DAL,ARI,1,13,7.1,2.7,"I know, I know... He's the No. 1 tight end in fantasy football, but I'm telling you to bench him. But facts are facts and the Cardinals are a great team when it comes to stopping tight ends. They allowed just two touchdowns in their last 18 games, and Jack Doyle ended a streak of 19 games where no tight end was able to top 53 yards. Witten gives you almost no ceiling this week. "
7,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,TB,4,20,8.6,2.9,"Rudolph hasn't been able to get much going yet in 2017, though he did find the end zone in Week 1. After leading all tight ends in targets last season, he's seen just nine targets so far in 2017. He draws a fairly neutral matchup  in Week 3 against the Bucs, who ranked middle of the pack both in terms of receptions and fantasy points allowed to tight ends in 2016. If Sam Bradford plays, then Rudolph will be, as he always is in those circumstances, a solid TE1. If Case Keenum remains under center, then Rudolph's value takes a bit of a hit. But Keenum targeted Rudolph six times last week, and that volume alone keeps him in the TE1 range regardless of his quarterback. "
8,Jack Doyle,IND,CLE,3,22,8.9,3.3,"Cleveland is by far the worst team in the NFL at defending tight ends and even though Andrew Luck is out again, Doyle and Brissett connected for a great Week 2 against the Cardinals, so you could stream-start Doyle and feel good about it."
9,Eric Ebron,DET,ATL,4,19,9.4,3.0,"Ebron thrived last week against the Giants, catching all five of his targets for 42 yards and a score. Week 3's matchup against the Falcons presents another opportunity for a big game for the tight end, as the Falcons allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends in 2016 and have struggled stopping that position since Dan Quinn's arrival. In a likely shootout, Ebron makes for a solid TE1 option, with a fairly high floor."
10,Jordan Reed,WAS,OAK,2,26,8.5,6.0,"Reed is going to be a game-time decision with a sternum injury, which puts fantasy owners in a bit of a pickle, as the Redskins play on Sunday Night Football against the Raiders. Reed owners would be wise to pick up Vernon Davis if they're intent on starting him. Reed is about as tough as they come, and has been decent in two tough matchup against the Eagles and the Rams so far this season. If he can play, it would be tough to bench him, as the Raiders' weakness on defense lies in the middle of the field, and Reed should be able to find plenty of open holes. If you have a capable backup, it's worth the risk to wait on Reed to see if he'll play."
11,Coby Fleener,NO,CAR,6,23,12.0,3.0,"Fleener has scored in both games this season, though it's worth noting that he did not have a reception until the second half last week against the Patriots. Still, his production when Willie Snead is out is undeniable, as he's scored in all three games over the past two seasons. He scored in both games against the Panthers last season, and the team struggles against tight ends generally. He would obviously be a much safer play if he wasn't so touchdown dependent, but for this week, he remains firmly in the TE1 discussion, albeit on the lower end."
12,Hunter Henry,LAC,KC,5,32,12.8,4.3,"With Eric Berry out, the Chiefs ought to move from one of the three toughest teams in football against tight ends to a mediocre defense. Still, Henry isn't seeing quite enough snaps still to be startable on a week to week basis."
13,Jared Cook,OAK,WAS,6,27,14.0,4.0,"Cook is probably the last guy you could make a case for starting this week. Oakland should pass a ton on Washington and Michael Crabtree will be wrapped up by Josh Norman, which means potentially more targets for Cook."
14,Jimmy Graham,SEA,TEN,4,33,14.1,4.9,"This matchup against the Titans isn't great, but that's not even the biggest worry with Graham, who was dinged up last week. His ankle was rolled up on and he's considered questionable for this games. On top of those negatives, Graham hasn't really performed even when healthy over his last 10 games, averaging 3.1 receptions for 38.7 yards and 0.3 touchdowns. It may be best to ensure that Graham is right before inserting him into lineups."
15,Charles Clay,BUF,DEN,9,25,14.9,3.2,"Charles Clay let down fantasy owners last week by posting a line of just 3/23/0. In a game where Taylor struggled, this makes sense. The matchup with the Broncos is another good one, as it seems to be one of their only weaknesses as a defense. After witnessing Jason Witten destroy them for 10 catches, 97 yards, and a touchdown, you likely know that. Clay will never be a fool-proof plan at tight end, seeing as the Bills throw the ball fewer than 30 times per game (ranked dead-last in 2016), but the matchup is solid, so Clay can be used as a streamer and solid TE2.  "
16,Benjamin Watson,BAL,JAC,2,23,15.1,3.7,"If you had one of the several injured TE1s this week, you could do worse than picking up Ben Watson, who had a big Week 2. Last season, we saw Flacco turn Dennis Pitta into a fantasy relevant tight end, so this year, if Watson keeps up the snap count, he is a solid multi-week replacement option."
17,Evan Engram,NYG,PHI,7,22,15.5,3.0,"Engram is a threat to break the curse of the rookie tight ends, already racking up eight catches for 93 yards and a touchdown. But he couldn't ask for a much tougher draw than Philadelphia here in Week 3. Although the Eagles got torched by Travis Kelce last week (8-103-1), they gave up the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing tight ends last season, and held Jordan Reed in check in Week 1. Engram deserves your attention in fantasy, but he's outside the TE1 conversation this week."
18,Austin Hooper,ATL,DET,6,31,17.6,4.0,"The Lions have looked solid this year, but one thing remains... they allow a lot of touchdowns to the tight end position. After allowing 10 last year, they've already let one get through the cracks this year, as Evan Engram was wide open for a touchdown last week. The Lions may also be without their starting middle linebacker Jarrad Davis, who is in the concussion protocol. "
19,Zach Miller,CHI,PIT,7,24,17.5,3.9,"Miller has 10 receptions on 15 targets in his first two games, and both numbers show that he's going to be a fine plug-in at tight end most weeks. The worry for Miller was never about his talent, but was instead much more about the presence of Adam Shaheen. But early indications are that Shaheen is simply a blocking tight end, and with reliable receivers few and far between for Chicago, Miller should continue to see plenty of targets. His longest reception this season is just 12 yards, so his yardage totals should continue to remain in check. But any tight end seeing that many targets is worth a look if you're struggling at that position."
20,Julius Thomas,MIA,NYJ,12,34,20.4,3.5
21,Vernon Davis,WAS,OAK,9,47,24.3,7.0,"Davis's value is entirely dependent on Jordan Reed's health, which is probably a good thing given Reed's history and that he's already battling injuries. Early reports continue to suggest that Reed's chest contusion he suffered in Week 2 will not prevent him from playing in Week 3 against the Raiders, which would prevent Davis from having any immediate value. But should Reed miss time with an injury, Davis would vault immediately into the low-end TE1 discussion. He's not one of the top waiver-wire targets by any means, but he's someone to consider adding if you have a deep bench or own Reed yourself."
22,Jesse James,PIT,CHI,6,31,22.1,4.0,"After James' big Week 1 with two touchdowns, he caught another four balls in Week 2. With Brown, Bryant, Bell and the addition of McDonald, who is in the process of figuring out the offense, James is not startable any week unless you are desperate for a last minute streamer."
23,Cameron Brate,TB,MIN,11,29,21.3,2.8
24,Austin Seferian-Jenkins,NYJ,MIA,12,40,24.3,5.4,"With all the of the injuries at the position, ASJ could be a fantasy hero. He is coming off of a suspension and is the only waiver wire player with true top 6 potential at his position. He is a freak athlete in a bad offense and could command a load of targets. With that being said, we have never seen competency from him, so this is a total boom or bust situation."
