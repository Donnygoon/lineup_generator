1,Aaron Rodgers,GB,CIN,1,8,1.4,1.1,"The only mild concern with Rodgers was the health of his wide receivers, but since it appears that Jordy Nelson is going to suit up for this one, Rodgers is a full-go. We haven't seen peak Rodgers yet this season, as he has just a 3:2 TD:INT ratio, but he's thrown for more than 300 yards in both games. The Bengals defense has not looked good this season, and should present no challenge to Rodgers. Perhaps the only thing that can slow him down is the blowout potential, as the Packers are heavily favored. This could mean that Rodgers won't need to throw quite as much as he otherwise would, but that's certainly not a reason to consider benching him. Really, there's never a reason to do that, so start him as a top option at quarterback, as always."
2,Tom Brady,NE,HOU,1,6,2.5,1.1,"Don't be too quick to look at this matchup and assume the worst. Houston lost A.J. Bouye this off-season and both of their starting corners might miss the game, which would leave undrafted rookies to be starting. Brady is a start even with a healthy Houston defense on the field though."
3,Matt Ryan,ATL,DET,1,10,3.3,1.3,"Ryan has been disappointing from a fantasy perspective through the first two games, but he's hardly to blame. Although he has just two touchdowns, he's thrown for 573 yards and has completed 69 percent of his passes. While the lack of touchdowns is disappointing, it seems pretty clear that Ryan hasn't missed much of a beat with new offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian. The Lions' passing defense is off to a terrific start, but it's still unclear whether the success is due to the talent-level or the poor quarterback play of the Lions' opponents (Carson Palmer and Eli Manning). Regardless, Ryan can pick apart any defense, and the Lions allowed only five rushing touchdowns to running backs last season, second in the league. That means the chances of multiple passing touchdowns is high in this one which, of course, keeps Ryan as a top-end QB1. "
4,Derek Carr,OAK,WAS,1,9,4.3,1.3,"Just one week after throwing three touchdowns on just 28 pass attempts, Derek Carr will look to build on that against a Redskins team that's allowed 8.3 yards per attempt to the combination of Carson Wentz and Jared Goff. The Redskins have allowed seven of the last 10 quarterbacks they've played to throw for at least 300 yards. In a game that has the highest implied total (not even close) of the week, Carr is locked in as a QB1 this week.  "
5,Matthew Stafford,DET,ATL,1,11,5.7,2.1,"Stafford continues to thrive under Jim Bob Cooter's offense, as he's taken on two tough defenses in the Cardinals and the Giants and emerged with an average of 25 fantasy points. The Falcons defense is not a pushover, but it has allowed 34 passing touchdowns since the beginning of 2016, and this game is expected to be a shootout. Stafford is a firm QB1 in this matchup, and could be considered a top-five option."
6,Cam Newton,CAR,NO,2,14,6.4,2.3,"Newton has looked somewhere between rusty and downright bad in his two games this season, completing just 34 of his 57 pass attempts and barely running the ball. He continues to recover from his shoulder injury, but now must learn to deal without his most trusted target, Greg Olsen. It's a fantastic matchup at home against the Saints, of course, but Newton has not looked reliable enough this season or last to be trustworthy. He remains a firm QB1 here in light of the matchup, but he's not the top option that owners expected him to be this week."
7,Drew Brees,NO,CAR,3,22,7.1,2.3,"Brees is off to an impressive start by mere mortal standards, but a disappointing one by his standards, as he's thrown for 647 yards and three touchdowns without turning the ball over in his first two contests. He now gets a Carolina defense that he knows well, and against which he threw for 285 yards and two touchdowns last season in the teams' matchup in Carolina. It's difficult to gauge the Panthers defense, as they've played the offensively-challenged 49ers and Bills so far, so we shouldn't read much into the fact that they have yet to allow a touchdown pass yet. But on the road in a divisional game, it's unlikely that this will be on of Brees' best efforts. He's still an obvious start, but expectations should be tempered."
8,Kirk Cousins,WAS,OAK,2,15,8.0,2.2,"Cousins looks like he misses Sean McVay, as he's failed to get on track in either of the Redskins' first two games. He has thrown for 240 yards or less against both the Eagles and the Rams, and has just two touchdowns with an interception. But Week 3's matchup against the Raiders presents an opportunity for Cousins to get right. The Raiders will be traveling cross-country and just allowed Josh McCown to throw for two touchdowns. At home and in a nationally-televised game that has the highest over/under of any game this week, both offenses should be ready to roll, which should lead to Cousins getting back on track."
9,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,CHI,3,15,8.6,2.2,Don't buy into the narrative that Big Ben is terrible on the road. It has been a small sample size which should come to an end this weekend against a banged up Bears defense that was already crummy to begin with. He is a must-star in all league formats.
10,Philip Rivers,LAC,KC,4,23,11.4,2.8,"Kansas City always has a strong secondary, but with Eric Berry out, it turns matchups like these from can't starts into could starts. Rivers isn't a QB1, but he isn't a bad option if you have no QB1."
11,Russell Wilson,SEA,TEN,2,19,11.4,2.9,"Russell Wilson has traditionally started the season slow. It's a large enough sample size, too, as this is his sixth NFL season. At some point, the Seahawks need to invest a lot of draft capital into their offensive line that cannot block to save their lives, or Wilson's. The Titans have just a 5.7 percent sack ratio, but they'll work their way through the Seahawks offensive line for a better one this week. The Titans secondary is by far the weakest point of their team and because of that, Wilson needs to remain in fantasy lineups. Of the last 13 quarterbacks to play against the Titans, only Alex Smith and Blake Bortles totaled less than 18.7 DraftKings points.  "
12,Carson Wentz,PHI,NYG,3,23,13.5,3.1,"Carson Wentz sits near the top of fantasy leaderboards with 640 yards and four touchdowns through two weeks, but he'll face his toughest competition yet when they host the Giants defense that's now held 17 of the last 18 quarterbacks to 17.9 or less fantasy points, including 14 of them with 15.9 or less points. Wentz is playing well, but this is not a week to trust him. "
13,Dak Prescott,DAL,ARI,6,22,13.6,3.3,"Prescott has performed admirably against two very difficult opponents, the Giants and the Broncos, putting up a total of 37 fantasy points, good for 11th-most among quarterbacks. His assignment doesn't get much easier in Week 3 against a tough Cardinals defense in Arizona on Monday night, and he's battling a minor ankle injury sustained against Denver in Week 2. The Cardinals defense isn't all it's cracked up to be anymore, as they were picked apart by Matthew Stafford in Week 1 and appear to desperately miss Calais Campbell. Prescott should be serviceable - he almost always is - but his upside is limited here, making him more of a very low-end QB1 or high-end QB2."
14,Jameis Winston,TB,MIN,9,22,14.1,2.9,"Winston was efficient in the Buccaneers' Week 2 win over the Bears, but he was far from spectacular, completing 18 of 30 passes for 204 yards and a touchdown. His performance is unlikely to get much better this week in Minnesota against a tough Vikings defense that held Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger to a combined 33 fantasy points. The Vikings are incredibly stingy against opposing QBs, rarely allowing a 300-yard passer, and it's unlikely that Winston will break that trend. In a tough road matchup, he's likely not a start for you outside of two-quarterback leagues."
15,Jay Cutler,MIA,NYJ,8,27,15.4,3.0,"This may be the closest Cutler gets to being startable all season. The Jets have a miserable defense so if you are looking for a streamer, he is a good bet to produce."
16,Marcus Mariota,TEN,SEA,9,23,15.8,2.5,"Mariota will be startable virtually every single week, but this is the legion of boom we are talking about. Don't panic when he has a low-end QB2 performance."
17,Carson Palmer,ARI,DAL,10,26,16.8,2.9,"The Cowboys' passing defense is not nearly as strong as it was last year with its brand new secondary, as evidenced by how easily Trevor Siemian carved them up last week. But Palmer has done himself no favors in the fantasy community through the first two weeks, struggling mightily against both the Lions and the Colts. The loss of David Johnson clearly took its toll on the offense, and John Brown's absence, which should extend to this week, doesn't help either. But the matchup gives Palmer a chance to get right here, particularly in the Cardinals' home opener in a nationally-televised game. He's far from trustworthy and is nothing more than a mid-range QB2, but has the potential to get back in his fantasy owners' good graces in a plus matchup."
18,Alex Smith,KC,LAC,10,25,16.9,2.8,"Smith tore up the Charges last season for his best game of the year. He is a decent start, but expecting a repeat performance is a little too optimistic. "
19,Trevor Siemian,DEN,BUF,11,25,18.0,2.8,"Siemian has two more good matchups coming up before his bye. He should continue to ""seem"" hot, at which point, you may be able to pawn him off on a trade opponent. His season long worth is less than replacement level, however."
20,DeShone Kizer,CLE,IND,9,28,19.7,3.3
21,Andy Dalton,CIN,GB,9,27,19.7,3.0,"It's been a rough start to the season for Andy Dalton and I'm not here to make excuses for him, but we must also keep in mind that he played against the Ravens and Texans in the first two weeks, two of the best defenses in the game. Dalton also deserves his fair share of the blame, but it's an extremely small sample size. You have to wonder how they'll look under Lazor this week and what the game plan will be, but you should expect a lot of A.J. Green, which almost always means good things for Dalton. The Packers defense is the perfect matchup for a ""get right"" type game. "
22,Jared Goff,LAR,SF,16,30,23.6,2.7,"Goff has looked competent in his time under new coach Sean McVay, with 525 passing yards and two touchdowns to just one interception in his first two games. He'll now go on the road for a Thursday night matchup against the 49ers, which presents a slightly more difficult matchup than at first appears. The San Francisco secondary isn't anything to write home about, but they've consistently gotten pressure on the opposing quarterback this season, keeping both Cam Newton and Russell Wilson in check. Goff can have success here with both Cooper Kupp and Sammy Watkins, but he'll need to play under control and no panic. Expect low-end QB2 production and hope for more."
23,Jacoby Brissett,IND,CLE,8,32,25.3,3.6
24,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,DEN,14,30,24.3,2.7
25,Deshaun Watson,HOU,NE,14,32,25.3,3.2,"Watson's big run has fantasy owners dreaming, and that may happen from time to time, but he won't be a start worthy player in one quarterback leagues except for just one or two streaming weeks all season."
26,Eli Manning,NYG,PHI,18,31,23.1,2.3,"Manning and the entire Giants offense has looked awful this season, as the offensive line is simply unable to get a push forward for the run game or keep defenders from getting pressure on Manning consistently. He'll now fact an Eagles team that has the fourth highest sack percentage in football in their home opener. Odell Beckham Jr. should be closer to 100 percent and Manning did relatively well against the Eagles last year (613 passing yards, five touchdowns), but it's difficult to see him being relevant in a league of any size given how he's played so far this year. To the extent Manning is to have any fantasy relevance this year, it's unlikely to be against the Eagles in Week 3."
27,Josh McCown,NYJ,MIA,11,32,27.0,2.7
28,Joe Flacco,BAL,JAC,21,32,25.8,2.2
29,Blake Bortles,JAC,BAL,21,32,28.9,2.0
30,Mike Glennon,CHI,PIT,22,33,29.6,2.0,"Glennon certainly cant be faulted for a lack of effort, as he's thrown 85 passes in just two games. Unsurprisingly, however, that hasn't resulted in positive fantasy results, as he's thrown for just two touchdowns and added two interceptions. He'll now take on a tough Steelers defense that rarely allows an opposing quarterback to reach 20 fantasy points. Considering that the Bears are beat up on their offensive line, it's highly doubtful that Glennon bucks the trend here. He's one of the worst possible fantasy options in Week 3."
31,Brian Hoyer,SF,LAR,22,32,30.3,2.3,"Through two games, Hoyer has looked nothing like the deep sleeper that some thought he might be this year under Kyle Shanahan. He's thrown two interceptions, zero touchdowns, and for just 292 passing yards in two games. This is a nationally-televised home game, and the Rams may be without their two top cornerbacks, so it's certainly possible that this will be Hoyer's best game he'll have all season. But even that might not be enough to make him a low-end QB2. He shouldn't be started here in any league absent no other options."
32,Case Keenum,MIN,TB,23,34,30.3,2.1,"Keenum will get his second start in as many weeks in Week 3, as Sam Bradford's knee injury will prevent him from suiting up against the Buccaneers. Keenum was simply not good in Week 2 against the Steelers, but it's hard to fault him, as he was pressed into starting duty against a very tough defense when Bradford couldn't give it a go. The Bucs defense was outstanding against a sub-par Bears team last week, and they should similarly make life difficult on Keenum. But with another week of practice under his belt, he may be able to keep the Vikings receivers fantasy relevant. As for Keenum himself, he's not startable in any fantasy league right now. "
33,Kevin Hogan,CLE,IND,32,35,33.1,0.8
