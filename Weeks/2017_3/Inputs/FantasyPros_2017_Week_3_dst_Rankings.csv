Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Baltimore Ravens,BAL,JAC,1,12,1.9,1.7,"The Ravens have allowed just 10 points this season. That's kind of nuts. This game will be a defensive battle and the biggest strength of the Jaguars team (running the ball) also happens to be the Ravens biggest strength as well (stopping the run). If Blake Bortles is forced to drop back and pass, start racking up the Ravens D/ST points. "
2,Denver Broncos,DEN,BUF,1,11,3.1,2.2,Denver is worth starting every single week unless the play the Packers or Patriots. Their defense has looked invincable through the first two weeks and should obliterate the Bills this weekend.
3,Pittsburgh Steelers,PIT,CHI,2,18,4.1,2.6,"If you've watched the Bears at all this year, you know why the Steelers are a must-play. Not only is Mike Glennon in danger of getting benched, but Jordan Howard is playing at less than 100 percent. The Bears may also be without their top two offensive lineman Kyle Long and Josh Sitton. Whatever the case, the Steelers make a great streamer this week. "
4,Los Angeles Rams,LAR,SF,1,16,5.8,2.9,"Brian Hoyer hasn't quite been terrible and can put some points up on the board, but with a healthy Aaron Donald and Robert Quinn, he should be on his toes all game which could lead to a handful of sacks and multiple turnovers for the Rams."
5,Philadelphia Eagles,PHI,NYG,1,24,6.2,3.4,"The Eagles D/ST has a ton of factors working in its favor in Week 3. Philadelphia hosts the Giants who, if you haven't been paying attention, have struggled mightily on offense. Eli Manning has already been sacked eight times and has thrown an interception in each games. This is the Eagles' home opener, they already have eight sacks on the year, and they had five interceptions last year against Manning. In other words, this is a perfect recipe for a huge performance, making the Eagles one of the top D/ST plays for Week 3."
6,New England Patriots,NE,HOU,1,17,6.1,3.4,"We have seen just how bad this Texans' offensive line can be when they allowed 10 sacks to the Jags in Week 1. The Pats don't have nearly the same pass rush, but 5 and a turnover or two is not out of question. They are a surefire DST1 this week."
7,Miami Dolphins,MIA,NYJ,1,17,6.6,2.9,"Miami has a top notch running defense and could get to McCown for several sacks. As always, we should expect multiple turnovers regardless of the Jets' opponent, so make sure to start Miami if you have them."
8,Green Bay Packers,GB,CIN,2,24,9.0,3.4,"The Packers D/ST hasn't done much this season, though it has tallied six sacks and a fumble recovery. But in a home game against Cincinnati, it has a chance to finally make a fantasy impact. The Bengals offense is the only one in the NFL without a touchdown yet this season, and Andy Dalton has struggled behind his porous offensive line. At home against a struggling Bengals team, expect the Packers to make some noise in this one. "
9,Seattle Seahawks,SEA,TEN,2,26,9.5,4.3,"The Seahawks D/ST has been adequate so far in 2017, but it's fair to say that its owners have been slightly disappointed. They've tallied six sacks and two interceptions, but haven't yet had the huge game that everyone is waiting for. People will probably be waiting even longer, as the Seahawks travel to Tennessee to face the Titans, who rarely gives up points to opposing D/STs (second fewest in the league so far in 2017). Things will get better in the near future for this unit (home against the Colts and at the Rams in the next two matchups). But this isn't a matchup to target."
10,Jacksonville Jaguars,JAC,BAL,2,21,10.2,3.2,"The Jaguars defense wasn't really to blame for the high total allowed last week, as their offense (Bortles specifically) and special teams continually put them in bad spots on the field. This game should be one to get back on track, as the Ravens offensive line is now missing two starters, including perennial Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda, their best one. "
11,Kansas City Chiefs,KC,LAC,1,20,10.8,2.9,"The Chiefs are worth starting most weeks, but Phillip Rivers and all his weapons puts them right on the border. Hopefully you have a better option, but if not, they likely won't hurt your score."
12,Minnesota Vikings,MIN,TB,3,21,12.8,2.7,"The Vikings D/ST is off to a slow start in 2017, with just three sacks total and no turnover in the first two games against the Saints and Steelers. They should have more of an opportunity to make plays this weekend against the Bucs at home, as Jameis Winston has been relatively turnover prone throughout his career. Minnesota has been a top D/ST for several years, and has many of the same playmakers, so it should be fine long-term. Expect a bit of a bounceback performance here."
13,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,TB,MIN,3,22,13.3,4.4,"The Buccaneers D/ST got off to a fine start in Week 2 against the Bears, allowing just seven points and totaling one sack, two interceptions, two fumble recoveries, and one touchdown. They'll face a much tougher test in Week 3 on the road against the Vikings, though there are some positive indicators. Case Keenum certainly did not look capable of putting up a ton of points last week, and even if Sam Bradford suits up, his lack of mobility should likely lead to opportunities for sacks. The Bucs D/ST makes a decent streaming option against the Vikings."
14,Tennessee Titans,TEN,SEA,4,26,13.9,3.5,"If you are absolutley desperate for a streamer defense, the Titans did work last weekend and have clearly improved. Russell Wilson has been slow to start and this Seahawks offensive line has been dreadful, so you could get away with starting Tennessee."
15,New York Giants,NYG,PHI,6,29,15.8,3.3,"The Giants D/ST hasn't really gotten going yet, totaling just four sacks and a fumble recovery through two games. But both Dallas and Detroit are usually stingy against opposing defenses, and the Giants defense remains every bit as strong as last year. The Eagles have allowed the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing D/STs, so there should be opportunities for plays, as Carson Wentz has thrown an interception in each game so far this season. It's not the greatest matchup on the road, but the Giants D/ST can certainly be a startable option if you're in a pinch."
16,Arizona Cardinals,ARI,DAL,3,30,15.9,4.3,"The Cowboys are coming off an embarrassing loss against the Broncos, while the Cardinals just struggled to beat the Colts. This isn't the same Cardinals defense they were two years ago, as they have allowed nine of the last 11 teams they played to score 20 or more points, including 30 or more to six of them. "
17,Carolina Panthers,CAR,NO,4,25,16.0,3.6
18,Cleveland Browns,CLE,IND,5,24,16.7,3.5
19,Oakland Raiders,OAK,WAS,5,27,19.8,3.4
20,Houston Texans,HOU,NE,10,32,21.7,4.2,"Yes, I'm aware you spent high draft capital on the Texans, but that doesn't mean you should play them on the road against the Patriots. They have an answer for the great pass rush, as they'll dump passes off to their running backs all game if they have to. If they give Brady time, he'll chuck it downfield to Brandin Cooks, who'll be matched up with two backup corners, as it seems both Kevin Johnson and Johnathan Joseph are out for this game. "
21,Indianapolis Colts,IND,CLE,3,25,18.2,4.6
22,Dallas Cowboys,DAL,ARI,6,26,19.5,4.5
23,San Francisco 49ers,SF,LAR,8,31,19.8,4.3
