Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,CHI,1,5,1.3,0.8,"You don't need me to tell you to start Antonio Brown, but this is more for you DFS players. Just one week after Brown finished with five catches for 62 yards, you'll want to bet on him destroying the Bears secondary, and specifically Marcus Cooper. Brown hasn't gone three games without a touchdown since way back in Weeks 3 through 7 in 2015. He's going to finish as a WR1 in this matchup.  "
2,Julio Jones,ATL,DET,1,8,2.5,1.1,"Jones' usage has been disappointing through the first two games, as he's seen just 14 targets. But he did total 108 yards receiving last week against Green Bay, and the majority of that came in the early going before the Falcons put their offense on cruise control. Jones will match up against Darius Slay in the Falcons' Week 3 matchup against the Lions, so he certainly doesn't have an easy task ahead of him. But Slay is no longer a shutdown corner at this point, and if the Lions try to contain Jones with 1-on-1 coverage, he should have a huge game. Either way, you're never benching one of the top receivers in the game, and he'll be a high-end WR1 here."
3,A.J. Green,CIN,GB,1,12,3.4,1.8,"Don't be too quick to sour on Green. He went up against two stellar defenses in the first two weeks. This week, he is among the top plays in all of football in what should be a shootout and negative game script."
4,Mike Evans,TB,MIN,2,18,5.7,2.8,"Evans saw more single coverage than usual in Week 1 against the Bears, and he put up his usual stellar line, catching seven of his nine targets for 93 yards and a touchdown. Even if he sees single coverage again this week, however, he may be in for a slightly down game against Xavier Rhodes, who had success against both Michael Thomas and Antonio Brown. The tough matchup isn't close to enough to move Evans out of the WR1 range, but playing in Minnesota against a tough defense certainly takes the bloom off of Evans' rose. Start him, of course, but this may not be one of his best efforts this season."
5,Michael Thomas,NO,CAR,2,18,6.9,4.0,"Thomas has gotten off to a slow start so far in 2017, but he really can't shoulder the blame, as he faced off against Xavier Rhodes in Week 1 and got the patented Patriots ""take away your opponent's best weapon"" treatment in Week 2. His life gets easier, though not by much, in Week 3 against the Panthers and James Bradberry. On the road and against a tough cornerback, it's doubtful that this will be one of Thomas' biggest games of the year. But it's likely to be his best game of the season thus far, and he's a solid WR1 on Sunday."
6,Odell Beckham Jr.,NYG,PHI,1,24,7.1,4.2,"I normally wouldn't feel the need to remind you to play Beckham, but some are concerned with his injury and are debating sitting him until he's right. Considering he played 34/56 snaps last week and left without a setback, he needs to be in lineups against an Eagles team whose weakness is their cornerbacks. Not to mention they'll be without their best one, Ronald Darby. Don't second guess Beckham this week, he's a must-start, regardless of who else you have. "
7,Keenan Allen,LAC,KC,1,21,7.1,3.3,"Allen has a picture perfect matchup this week, as he will be going against the Chiefs lousy backup slot corner. Allen should see double digit targets once again and may end up a top five wideout."
8,Michael Crabtree,OAK,WAS,5,35,10.7,4.9,"Crabtree should get the Josh Norman treatment for 60% of his snaps, which will slow his production quite a bit. Still, he is a WR2 because the other 40% of the snaps will be against one of the worst secondaries in football."
9,Amari Cooper,OAK,WAS,3,25,11.5,4.8,"Crabtree is the one likely to go up against Josh Norman the most, so that leaves Cooper to exploit the remainder of the lackluster Redskins' secondary. He should be regarded as a top 15 WR this week."
10,Jordy Nelson,GB,CIN,2,26,11.6,5.8,"It looked early in the week like Nelson would be on the sidelines for Week 3's game after being pulled early from Week 2's matchup against the Falcons with a quad injury. But practice reports have been positive for Nelson, and it looks like he'll play. If he does suit up, the chance of him aggravating the injury raise some concerns, but his opportunity for a successful fantasy day should far outweigh any doubts. Nelson will likely draw Dre Kirkpatrick in coverage, who is a fine, but beatable cornerback. In addition, Randall Cobb is doubtful for the game, and in the three games that Cobb missed last season, Nelson had 19 catches for 314 yards and three touchdowns. That makes Nelson a WR1 here, despite the injury concerns."
11,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,NO,5,25,14.0,4.7,"Kelvin Benjamin has always been a target monster, but he'll see increased usage now with Olsen out. He should be considered a solid WR2 in this matchup, as the Saints are already lacking talent, but may be without first-round rookie cornerback Marshon Lattimore who is going through the concussion protocol. Don't forget they are already without Delvin Breaux, their top cornerback.  "
12,Brandin Cooks,NE,HOU,6,29,14.1,6.0,"Cooks hasn't quite taken off yet, and although you may be inclined to think otherwise, this is actually a great spot for him, as both Texans' corners are banged up so he may be going against an undrafted rookie."
13,Doug Baldwin,SEA,TEN,8,27,14.4,4.4,"Like most of the Seattle offense, Baldwin has had trouble producing so far in 2017, hauling in 10 of 13 targets for just 107 yards through two games. He'll get his chances this weekend against the Titans and Logan Ryan, against whom he totaled 101 yards and scored a touchdown when the two faced off last year when Ryan was with New England. Baldwin is far from a sure thing, as evidenced by his struggles so far this season. But his potential and matchup here make him a fine option, albeit just a high-end WR2."
14,Tyreek Hill,KC,LAC,1,23,14.8,4.2,"The Chargers have some quality cornerbacks, but none who go inside or can cover Hill's speed. He should have another quality game with substantial upside in what may end up a shootout."
15,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,BUF,4,23,15.7,4.0,"Siemian has been on fire to start the season, mostly because of two cupcake matchups, but we should see the same once again in Week 3 against Buffalo. Thomas will see enough targets to make himself a top 15 wideout."
16,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,NE,6,34,16.0,5.9,"The Patriots always attempt to remove the opposing team's No. 1 option in the passing game and have succeeded thus far, holding Travis Kelce to five catches for 40 yards and Michael Thomas to five catches for 89 scoreless yards. DeAndre Hopkins is going to be a low-end WR2 in this game because of all the volume he gets, but I wouldn't get excited when placing him in my lineup."
17,Golden Tate,DET,ATL,7,24,16.3,3.0,"Tate had a great effort in Week 1 against the Cardinals, hauling in 10 out of 12 targets for 107 yards. But he was targeted just four times last week against the Giants (catching all of them) and totaled just 25 yards. Things should get better this week against Atlanta in a likely shootout, as he's averaged seven receptions and 80 yards receiving in his last four home games. He should see Brian Poole most often in coverage, which should limit Tate's big-play potential. But Tate should still see plenty of targets in this one, and the volume should keep in him the WR2 discussion, particularly in PPR leagues."
18,Davante Adams,GB,CIN,5,42,16.6,5.9,"Adams got back on track in Week 2 against the Falcons, catching eight of his 10 targets for 99 yards and a touchdown. With Jordy Nelson likely to play, Adams will likely see Adam Jones in coverage, which presents a touch matchup. Still, with Randall Cobb doubtful, Adams should have plenty of chances for production, as he totaled 22 catches for 149 yards and three touchdowns in the three games Cobb missed last season. With guaranteed targets, he should make for a fine WR2 play here."
19,Dez Bryant,DAL,ARI,4,27,16.6,5.6,"Bryant keeps marching on through his slate of tough cornerback matchups, as he'll draw the Cardinals and Patrick Peterson in Week 3. It's fair to say that Bryant has exceeded expectations in light of the matchups he's faced, as he found the end zone and had seven catches last week against Aqib Talib. Prescott is not shying away from Bryant's matchup, as he's targeted him a whopping 25 times in two games. Regardless of the opposing cornerback, that level of volume should provide a fairly safe floor for Bryant. While he again may fall outside of the WR1 range, he's no worse than a rock-solid WR2."
20,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,DAL,2,38,17.1,5.6,"If we didn't know who Fitzgerald was, he'd probably be on the waiver wire at this point. Fitzgerald has received 19 targets the first two weeks but has turned them into just nine receptions for 95 yards without a score. Coming off the heels of a nearly invisible second half last season, and it seems like Fitzgerald's time as a fantasy asset may be over. The Cowboys secondary is entirely beatable, and in the nationally-televised home opener, this is about as good a chance as Fitzgerald will have to make a statement. He's still a startable option for now - think WR3 with upside - but if he falters again, he may be purely a bench option going forward."
21,Jarvis Landry,MIA,NYJ,8,26,18.8,3.4
22,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,NYG,6,30,20.6,4.3,"Jeffery had a big performance in Week 2 against Kansas City, with seven catches for 92 yards and a touchdown, but he'll have a tougher matchup to contend with here against the Giants. New York has not allowed more than eight fantasy points in standard leagues to any receiver so far this season, and the defense has allowed just three receivers to surpass 100 yards last year. Janoris Jenkins may need another week to recover from his ankle injury, which would boost Jeffery's value a bit. But he'll still be a low-end WR2, at best, in the unfavorable matchup."
23,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,OAK,9,37,21.8,5.2,"Pryor has struggled this season, with just six catches for 97 yards and no touchdowns through two games. He and Kirk Cousins do not seem to be on the same page often, and Pryor has struggled with drops even when they do. But Week 3 presents a big opportunity for Pryor. The Raiders have a decent secondary, but they are susceptible to the deep pass and to speedy wide receivers, and Pryor fits that mold perfectly. In a likely high-scoring affair, Pryor will get a ton of opportunities to prove his worth both to the Redskins and to fantasy owners."
24,Devante Parker,MIA,NYJ,4,43,23.1,5.6,"Parker had a nice start to the season with 85 yards, but it was Landry who saw most of the targets. That had more to do with the matchup, however, as Cutler was on his toes in pressure. This week, Parker could be the one that feasts in their matchup against the Jets."
25,Emmanuel Sanders,DEN,BUF,14,41,23.3,3.5,"Sanders scored two touchdowns last week as Siemian continued his excellent start. We shouldn't qyite expect that again, but it is a quality matchup that should lead to a high-end WR3 performance."
26,Martavis Bryant,PIT,CHI,10,70,28.2,7.9,"The Bears have slowed down top-notch receivers like Antonio Brown for a few years running now, so it could be Bryant who has a killer game in what should be considered a top-tier matchup."
27,Stefon Diggs,MIN,TB,4,43,29.1,5.4,"The excitement over Diggs' fantasy value came crashing down last week, as he caught just two of six targets for 27 yards with Case Keenum throwing him the ball. There's optimism that Sam Bradford will return this week, which will certainly boost Diggs' value, though he draws a fairly tough matchup with Bent Grimes. Even if Keenum plays, fantasy owners can expect him to improve on his abysmal Week 2 performance against a tough Steelers defense, as the Vikings return home to play in front of a friendly crowd. Diggs makes a reliable WR3 if Bradford starts, and a risky one if he does not."
28,Pierre Garcon,SF,LAR,20,44,30.5,4.3,"Garcon had just 3 receptions in Week 2, but that was against the Seahawks. This Thursday, we should expect much more similar production to what we saw in Week 1 with 6 catches for 81 yards. He is a WR3 this week at home against the Rams."
29,Jamison Crowder,WAS,OAK,18,54,31.7,5.9,"Crowder again had a disappointing effort in Week 2 against the Rams, though he looked healthy and did come down with four receptions (on five targets) for 47 yards. The entire Redskins passing offense has looked out of sorts after Sean McVay's departure, but Sunday night against the Raiders should provide for a get-right game. Not only is it a nationally-televised home game with the highest over/under of the week, but Crowder will be matched up against T.J. Carrie, who allows more than 20 yards per reception. If Crowder is going to be a fantasy asset this year, he's likely going to start proving his worth here."
30,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,JAC,24,48,32.0,3.9,"Some see the Jaguars and automatically think, ""He's a sit because he'll see Jalen Ramsey,"" but that's not the case with Maclin. Not 70 percent of the time, anyways, because Maclin has been playing the old Steve Smith role, which occupies the slot more often than not, and Ramsey doesn't go into the slot. Maclin can be started as you normally would. "
31,T.Y. Hilton,IND,CLE,22,52,32.4,5.4,"New quarterback Jacoby Brissett showed the willingness to target Hilton in a tough matchup against Patrick Peterson, so why doubt him in a good matchup against the Browns who are lacking a pass rush while Myles Garrett is shelved. Hilton should have time to get open in this matchup. "
32,J.J. Nelson,ARI,DAL,19,53,32.5,6.0,"Nelson had a big Week 2 against the Colts in place of John Brown, hauling in five of seven targets for 120 yards and a touchdown, and having a second touchdown catch overturned on replay. With Brown likely to miss at least Week 3, Nelson becomes an absolute must-add. Jaron Brown saw more snaps than Nelson against the Colts, but that's irrelevant. Nelson has scored in both games this season, and saw nearly 10 targets per game in the final three games of last season, showing that he's a solid fantasy option regardless of his snap count. With Arizona lacking explosive playmakers, Nelson is a threat to go off each and every week, and can be started with confidence this week against Dallas and every week until or unless John Brown returns."
33,DeSean Jackson,TB,MIN,22,59,34.5,6.0,"If you missed the Bucs game last week, Jackson nearly had two touchdowns. He just missed getting his feet in bounds on one, and was overthrown by just half a yard in what would have been a long touchdown. If you witnessed what Martavis Bryant did to the Vikings last week, you know they're susceptible to speed down the field. Jackson has WR1 upside this week while Mike Evans sees Xavier Rhodes.  "
34,Chris Hogan,NE,HOU,26,64,35.7,6.7
35,Sammy Watkins,LAR,SF,24,58,35.6,5.8,"Fantasy owners have come to expect even less from Watkins than is reasonable after the trade to a ""bad offense"", the limited targets in the first two weeks and all oft he injuries, but we are talking about one of the most talented receivers in football against one of the worst defenses. He is a surefire start."
36,Adam Thielen,MIN,TB,21,62,36.6,7.0,"Thielen's value took a hit with Case Keenum under center last week, but it did not torpedo quite as badly as Stefon Diggs', as he caught four of his five targets last week for 44 yards. The hope is that Sam Bradford can return this week from a bone bruise in his knee, which would allow Thielen to exploit his matchup with Robert McClain. Absent Bradford, it's difficult to trust any Vikings pass-catcher. But with optimism on Bradford's playing status, consider Thielen a solid WR3 with upside. "
37,Marqise Lee,JAC,BAL,17,63,38.0,5.9,"Lee isn't going to win you any championships, but he is the #1 receiver on the team and has seen a big share of the intended air yards from Blake Bortles. He should never be started if you can avoid it, but he is as good of a reliable depth piece as you can find so that you can start in the case of an injury of bye week."
38,Rashard Higgins,CLE,IND,12,59,37.8,7.3,"Just last week, Higgins was on the practice squad, and now he appears to be the Browns #1 wide receiver moving forward. Corey Coleman broke his hand, Kenny Britt has disappeared, and Higgins saw 12 targets last week. According to Matt Harmon, the wide receiver whisperer, Higgins ran a stellar route tree too, so he could be a breakout player with enough volume."
39,Tyrell Williams,LAC,KC,27,59,38.0,6.4,"Tyrell Williams is the one who'll suffer as Keenan Allen sees large target numbers and it'll be justified this week, as Williams will see a lot of Chiefs top cornerback Marcus Peters in coverage. He'll also see Terrance Mitchell, who is more of an average talent, so there's room for production, but you shouldn't bank on it. "
40,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,MIA,21,66,39.2,6.4,"Like him or not, Josh McCown just keeps throwing the ball to Kearse. His upside is nothing more than a low-end WR3, but with this volume of targets, he is a safe WR5 piece, and you can never have too much depth. Don't go crazy bidding on him, but he is better than keeping an Eddie Lacy or Kenny Britt."
41,Cooper Kupp,LAR,SF,20,56,40.5,5.4,"Kupp has been seeing plenty of targets while opposing defenses focused on Sammy Watkins, but he has just 7 receptions to speak of. He is still a low-end flex play this week because of the expected volume and easy matchup, but the hype is a little overblown at this point."
42,Allen Hurns,JAC,BAL,27,63,43.7,5.6,"Blake Bortles got Hurns a dozen garbage time points in Week 2, so don't look at this game as though Hurns was dominant or anything close to it. With that said, he does possess a strong ceiling each week and enough of a floor to warrant starting in a pinch if he has a decent matchup."
43,Ted Ginn,NO,CAR,30,54,43.9,5.1,"Ginn has been a miss so far in fantasy leagues, as he's seen 11 targets, but turned them into just seven catches for 77 yards. Taking what he was thought as, Brandon Coleman now has 95 yards and a touchdown in his 'big-slot' role. This would be considered a revenge game for Ginn, but it also happens to be a great matchup for him. The Panthers were destroyed by quick wide receivers last year, allowing big games to guys like Torrey Smith, J.J. Nelson, Tyreek Hill, Tyler Lockett, and DeSean Jackson. Ginn is always going to give you a low floor, but his ceiling makes him worth WR3/4 consideration. "
44,Mohamed Sanu,ATL,DET,29,65,45.2,6.2,"After an incredibly disappointing 2016 campaign, Sanu has quietly had a very effective beginning to his 2017 season, catching 11 of his 16 targets for 132 yards. Between Atlanta's excellent running backs and Julio Jones, opposing defenses have plenty to contend with, which should allow Sanu to have a fairly decent floor each week as Matt Ryan will give him enough targets to stay relevant. He's unlikely to have huge weeks, even if Jones were to miss time with an injury. But for those in deeper leagues who just need some production out of a WR3 spot, Sanu is a fine option."
45,Danny Amendola,NE,HOU,22,63,45.7,10.2
46,Marvin Jones,DET,ATL,27,66,45.9,6.0,"Jones' 2017 campaign is off to a strange start, as he's caught just three passes on seven targets for a mere 64 yards, but has two touchdown catches in the process. The end zone is where Jones continues to derive his fantasy value, as he's now scored in four straight games, including the preseason. He'll likely face off against Desmond Trufant in this one, a tough matchup, but owners aren't expecting much in terms of yardage anyway. Jones' lack of usage makes him a touchdown-dependent WR4 against Atlanta in Week 3."
47,Rishard Matthews,TEN,SEA,23,54,45.4,5.2
48,Kendall Wright,CHI,PIT,19,63,46.2,7.0,"As expected, Wright saw an uptick in targets in Week 2 with Kevin White's injury, as Mike Glennon threw 10 passes Wright's way after giving him just four targets in Week 1. Wright hauled in seven of his 10 targets for 69 yards. He should continue to see nearly double-digit targets each week going forward, as the Bears should continue to play from behind and have few reliable receiving options. But Glennon's limitations and Wright's lack of explosiveness make him more of a PPR option than a standard-league option. He's your classic high-floor, low-ceiling player, which is plenty useful if your team is strong otherwise, but don't look to him to be a savior."
49,Devin Funchess,CAR,NO,31,82,49.5,9.2,"If there's any silver lining to the Greg Olsen injury, it's that Devin Funchess should become much more involved in the Panthers offense. Funchess caught four of his seven targets for 68 yards in Week 2 against Buffalo, and his receptions and targets trailed only Kelvin Benjamin. Funchess has disappointed fantasy owners for his first two years in the league, but he at least has the opportunity to become an integral part of the Carolina offense with Olsen's injury. Cam Newton's ineffectiveness may limit Funchess's ceiling a bit, but his potential makes him an intriguing waiver wire add, both for the season and for a one-week fill-in against the Saints in Week 3."
50,Kenny Golladay,DET,ATL,32,70,49.6,6.8,"The buzz around Golladay came to a screeching halt last week against the Giants, as he caught just one pass on three targets for eight yards after his huge Week 1 performance. The first two weeks exemplify what the young receiver should be this season - incredibly inconsistent, with the occasional monster game. While Week 3 presents the opportunity for a shootout against the Falcons, Golladay is unlikely to see a significant share of the targets, given the presence of the Lions' other receivers and how much Atlanta struggles against pass-catching running backs. He's a WR4 on Sunday, at best."
51,Eric Decker,TEN,SEA,33,68,49.3,5.5
52,Sterling Shepard,NYG,PHI,39,69,52.5,5.2
53,Tyler Lockett,SEA,TEN,38,86,53.2,6.7,"Although the Seattle offense continues to look awful, Lockett's stock is rising quickly after his performance on Sunday against the 49ers. The stat line doesn't jump out at you - six receptions for 64 yards - but it doesn't tell the whole story. Lockett received nine targets and played nearly 75 percent of the snaps in Week 2, compared to only two targets and about 50 percent of the snaps in Week 1 against Green Bay. With Paul Richardson nursing a (grotesque) finger injury, Lockett's role should only increase going forward, making him a fine pickup both long-term and for this coming week against the Titans."
54,Randall Cobb,GB,CIN,28,138,59.3,26.7
55,Jaron Brown,ARI,DAL,38,97,57.0,8.5
56,Paul Richardson,SEA,TEN,47,84,57.1,6.4
57,Brandon Marshall,NYG,PHI,47,78,58.1,6.3
58,Kenny Stills,MIA,NYJ,36,85,57.6,6.2,"Stills can run the deep route and score a long touchdown with the best of them, but he doesn't get enough work to be considered a flex play outside of bench weeks or when one of your starters is injured. He can be added to fantasy rosters, but you would be better off picking up a high-end backup running back for that final roster spot."
59,Cole Beasley,DAL,ARI,37,68,57.5,6.4
60,Geronimo Allison,GB,CIN,33,95,60.4,11.0,"Allison got involved in Week 2 against the Falcons with three catches on five targets for 24 yards, as Packers wide receivers started dropping like flies. Those injuries make Allison an intriguing waiver wire add, as both Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb could potentially miss out on Week 3's game against the Bengals. Allison totaled eight catches for 157 yards and a touchdown in the final two weeks of the regular season last year, and anyone who could have a prominent role in an Aaron Rodgers-led offense is worth monitoring. Allison isn't a play if both Nelson and Cobb suit up, and is only a dart throw play if one of them misses a game. But there are few options on the waiver wire with as much potential as Allison if things break right, so consider him a name to add and to deploy under the right circumstances."
61,Jordan Matthews,BUF,DEN,40,86,59.0,6.4
62,Brandon LaFell,CIN,GB,43,77,61.2,8.0
63,Nelson Agholor,PHI,NYG,42,77,60.0,6.8,"Those who wasted a significant portion of their FAAB or a high waiver pick on Agholor after Week 1 were surely disappointed with the receiver's production in Week 2, as he caught just one pass for nine yards, though it was a touchdown catch. But Agholor's three targets against the Chiefs showed that he hasn't suddenly vaulted into a reliable option for either the Eagles or fantasy owners. Both Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith, not to mention Zach Ertz, appear to be Carson Wentz's preferred options, making Agholor a mostly touchdown-dependent option. Still, he's scored in each of the Eagles' first two games, so he's worth adding in the hope that he becomes Wentz's go-to red zone option."
64,Mike Wallace,BAL,JAC,46,87,61.1,6.1
65,Donte Moncrief,IND,CLE,42,76,62.4,6.5
66,Kenny Britt,CLE,IND,44,77,63.7,6.8
67,Brandon Coleman,NO,CAR,51,76,66.7,6.3,"Coleman put forth a solid effort against the Patriots in Week 2, with four receptions on six targets for 82 yards and a touchdown. With Willie Snead on the verge of coming back in Week 4, it's unlikely that Coleman has much staying power as a fantasy-relevant option. But, considering he's seeing more percentage of snaps in the early going than Ted Ginn, he makes a decent plug-and-play option against the Panthers for Week 3."

80,Josh Bellamy,CHI,PIT,56,104,85.4,9.5,"Bellamy was fairly heavily involved in Week 2 against the Bucs, seeing seven targets and catching four of them for 51 yards. He's not a special talent, and he's behind both Kendall Wright and Deonte Thompson in the pecking order of Bears wide receivers, but anyone with a pulse who is running routes for Chicago should at least give some fantasy value. He's not a viable play this week against a very tough Steelers defense, but he should see a decent share of targets and be someone to keep an eye on in deeper leagues."

92,Deonte Thompson,CHI,PIT,66,102,86.6,7.1,"Thompson scored the Bears' lone touchdown in Week 2 against the Bucs, and hauled in four of his five targets for 57 yards in the game. The Bears offense has been underwhelming (to put it mildly), and it's unlikely to look much better against the Steelers in Week 3. But Mike Glennon has to throw the ball to someone, and there simply aren't many reliable options in Chicago. Thompson will likely continue to trail Kendall Wright and perhaps Zach Miller in targets each week, but if he can continue to make the most of his opportunities, he could be a fantasy option later in the season."
