3,Jay Ajayi,MIA,NYJ,1,10,3.7,2.1
4,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,ARI,1,11,4.6,2.0,"Elliott had by far the worst game of his career in Week 2 against the Broncos, as he gained just eight yards on nine carries and added 14 yards receiving on four carries. He now has the unfortunate task of going up against a Cardinals defense that is allowing just 2.3 yards per carry so far this season. But, putting last week's stunner aside, Elliott and the massive Cowboys offensive line can handle any defense, and there's no chance you're going to sit Elliott here. While this may not be his best game of the season, owners should start him with confidence and expect a major bounce-back game."
5,Todd Gurley,LAR,SF,1,11,5.5,1.9,"This 49ers had a historically bad run defense last season, and while Bowman is back, they are still among the worst in the league. Gurley has looked significantly better behind Andrew Whitworth and in McVay's offense to use him as a clear RB1 this week."
6,Ty Montgomery,GB,CIN,1,12,6.1,1.9,"Montgomery has been on the field a ridiculous amount so far in 2017, playing on 139 out of 158 possible snaps. While he's struggled from a YPC basis, his heavy involvement and nose for the end zone have made him a top option at running back so far. That trend shouldn't end this week against the Bengals, who have struggled on defense so far in 2017 and come in as heavy underdogs. With the Green Bay receivers somewhat banged up and the team likely to be playing from ahead, expect Montgomery to get a significant number of carries and produce once again for fantasy owners."
7,Devonta Freeman,ATL,DET,2,21,6.4,2.8,"Freeman hasn't lit the world on fire with his rushing ability yet in 2017 (just 3.9 YPC), but he's managed to find the end zone three times in his first two games. He may have trouble continuing the latter trend against the Lions in Week 3, as Detroit allowed only five rushing touchdowns to running backs all last year. But the disparity between Freeman and Tevin Coleman's usage got larger in Week 2 (17-snap gap vs. 12-snap gap in Week 1), which is obviously a good sign for Freeman going forward. He's an RB1 in this matchup, as he will be most weeks, but his ceiling is a bit lower than it has been in either previous matchup this season."
8,Melvin Gordon,LAC,KC,2,14,7.7,2.0
9,LeSean McCoy,BUF,DEN,5,19,9.8,2.4
10,Carlos Hyde,SF,LAR,2,15,10.4,2.3,"Hyde has been terrific in limited usage so far this season. The primary reason for his low volume has been the game scripts. This week, that could change as the 49ers will be playing at home against another less than mediocre team. If they keep it close, Hill could be a top 5 running back."
11,C.J. Anderson,DEN,BUF,1,16,10.8,2.5
12,Dalvin Cook,MIN,TB,9,27,13.4,2.9,"Cook impressed again last week, gaining 64 yards on 12 carries (5.3 YPC) against a tough Steelers defense, and had a touchdown overturned on replay. The rookie has incredible talent, but it remains to be seen whether he'll get any goal-line work, as C.J. Ham was given the carry from the one-yard-line, and Latavius Murray is always lurking. Cook is always a must-start option, but the Bucs are tough on the run, allowing only two running backs to go for more than 90 yards last year. If Sam Bradford suits up, Cook is likely a low-end RB1 even in the tough matchup, but should be considered more of an RB2 if Case Keenum is under center once again. "
13,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,NO,5,23,14.1,3.3,"McCaffrey hasn't gotten off to the start his fantasy owners had hoped for, with just 21 carries for 57 yards and nine receptions for 72 yards. McCaffrey will see better days, and it will probably begin this week with a matchup against the Saints. With Greg Olsen's injury, McCaffrey should see a jump in targets, and even if he continues to struggle to run the ball, he should have a high floor with his likely strong involvement in the passing game. He's a solid RB2 in both PPR and standard leagues, though his value obviously rises in the former format."
14,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,WAS,7,28,15.4,3.2
15,Leonard Fournette,JAC,BAL,3,31,15.6,4.1
16,Tarik Cohen,CHI,PIT,8,30,16.3,3.9,"Cohen has vastly outplayed Jordan Howard so far this season, including in Week 2 against the Bucs when he rushed for just 13 yards on seven carries (he did had eight receptions for 55 yards). The signs are pointing toward Howard suiting up for Week 3's matchup against the Steelers, but that doesn't do all that much to hurt Cohen's value. His small size makes it unlikely he could handle full running back duties anyway, and his heavy involvement in the passing game (eight receptions in each of the first two games) provides a high floor, particularly since the Bears should be trailing against the Steelers. Cohen makes a fine RB2 play in both standard and PPR leagues."
17,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,IND,10,30,16.4,3.3,"Anyone who drafted Isaiah Crowell in the third-round this offseason is likely kicking themselves at this point, but if there's silver lining to all of this, it's that he plays the Colts this week. After shutting down the backups of the Cardinals, their stat sheet looks better, but they've still allowed the opposing running back at least 15.7 PPR points in 14 of their last 18 games, including 19 touchdowns to them during that span. Crowell is a high-end RB2 this week who should find the end zone. "
18,Javorius Allen,BAL,JAC,9,29,17.5,4.0
19,James White,NE,HOU,14,38,21.1,4.1,"James White is an every-week play, as he's totaled 73 snaps through two weeks while Rex Burkhead has played 18 and Dion Lewis has played 20. He's getting touches, too, as he now has 23 of them for 164 yards, though he's yet to score. There'll be a game very soon where he scores two touchdowns and it could be this one, as the Texans have struggled against pass-catching running backs. White is a great RB3 in standard and a solid RB2 in PPR formats. "
20,Mike Gillislee,NE,HOU,7,39,21.9,4.9
21,Theo Riddick,DET,ATL,7,34,21.9,5.1,"With Ameer Abdullah dominating touches in the Lions backfield, Riddick hasn't had much of an opportunity to produce, averaging just 9.5 touches per game, though he did score a touchdown in Week 1. But he couldn't ask for a much better opponent than the Falcons, who allowed the most receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns to opposing running backs last year, and have similarly struggled already this year. This game looks like it has shootout potential, which could mean that Riddick gets additional work in the passing game. Against Atlanta, that makes Riddick a viable play in both standard and PPR leagues as an RB3."
22,Lamar Miller,HOU,NE,11,36,22.4,4.4,"Through two weeks, the Patriots have allowed 250 yards on 35 carries (7.14 YPC) with two touchdowns and another 177 yards and two touchdowns through the air. This could be a week where Miller actually surprises because there should be some garbage time yards accumulated. Consider him an RB2 despite the loss of work to Foreman last week."
23,Ameer Abdullah,DET,ATL,11,39,23.5,5.5,"Abdullah has been the workhorse back that his owners had hoped he would be, totaling 32 carries through two games and setting a career-high in rushing yards last week against the Giants with 86. The Falcons allowed the most receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns to running backs last year, and have struggled mightily against Tarik Cohen and Ty Montgomery through the first two games. Abdullah should have plenty of opportunities here for production both on the ground and through the air, and makes a rock solid RB2."
24,Mark Ingram,NO,CAR,17,76,25.9,7.0,"The Saints backfield is a mess right now and it seems there is no clarity coming any time soon. Ingram played the most snaps among the running backs, but the split was 36 for Ingram and 32 for the combination of Alvin Kamara and Adrian Peterson. The Panthers front-seven allowed just 3.8 YPC last season and are coming off a game in which they held LeSean McCoy to nine yards on 12 carries. Ingram will always have a shot to score in a high-scoring offense, but we don't even know if he'll get goal-line carries at this point. "
25,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,NO,13,41,26.5,5.3,"Stewart has gotten plenty of work so far this season, with 33 carries over his first two games. Although he's averaged barely over three yards per carry, his fantasy value has been salvaged somewhat by a receiving touchdown in Week 1. The Saints present an interesting matchup in Week 2, as they're actually decent in terms of rushing yards allowed to running backs (tied for 15th in the league last year), but they've allowed 19 rushing touchdowns since the beginning of 2016. With the Panthers trying to protect Cam Newton more this season, Stewart should see some goal-line carries in this one, leaving him with a good opportunity for a touchdown. That makes him a low-end RB2, though one without much upside. "
26,Chris Thompson,WAS,OAK,18,40,26.7,4.4,"Thompson had a huge Week 2 against the Rams, rushing for 77 yards and two touchdowns on just three carries, and adding three receptions for 29 yards. As great as Thompson has been this season, he's gotten only 13 touches (six rushing attempts, seven receptions) in the first two games, which isn't usually a formula for success. But with Rob Kelley's rib injury, Thompson may be in line for more touches going forward, which should cement his role as a viable weekly play in both standard and PPR leagues. He's a must-add and a solid play this week against the Raiders."
27,Derrick Henry,TEN,SEA,13,45,27.5,6.4
28,Tevin Coleman,ATL,DET,20,41,28.0,3.8,"Coleman's short receiving touchdown in Week 2 has saved his fantasy value so far this season, as he's otherwise averaging just 10 touches and 51.5 total yards per game. More concerning than his lack of production is that he received 17 fewer snaps than Devonta Freeman last week, showing that Coleman may not have quite the involvement his owners expected going forward. The Lions allowed just five rushing touchdowns to running backs last year, making this a less than ideal matchup for Coleman, whose value is pretty much tied to his ability to find the end zone. He's a low-end RB3 here, and doesn't have much upside absent a Freeman injury."
29,Chris Carson,SEA,TEN,17,55,29.3,5.5,"Carson was one of the few Seahawks to have a big showing on offense on Sunday against the 49ers, gaining 93 yards on 20 carries and adding one reception for seven yards. He was clearly the most effective running back for Seattle in the game, and it would be shocking if he did not see a significant role going forward, particularly with Eddie Lacy being inactive in Week 2. But the game against the 49ers marked Thomas Rawls's first game back from a high ankle sprain, so he may see more work in Week 3 against the Titans and going forward. But even with an atrocious offensive line, Carson makes one of the top waiver wire pickups this week, as he could easily take and run with the starting running back job."
30,Jacquizz Rodgers,TB,MIN,18,39,29.5,4.9,"The Vikings are one of the better run stopping teams in the league, as they allowed just nine touchdowns total to running backs last year, and two of those were to David Johnson. Through two weeks, they've held the Saints and Steelers running backs to just 152 yards on 49 carries (3.10 YPC) without a single score. Rodgers is just a volume RB3 this week whose stat sheet will look really boring if he doesn't score.  "
31,Darren Sproles,PHI,NYG,18,41,30.8,5.3,"Sproles led the Eagles in touches in Week 2 against Kansas City with 10 carries and two receptions for 78 total yards. The Giants generally do well against pass-catching backs, and did not allow a single receiving touchdown to them last year. Still, Sproles had some success last year and did score a rushing touchdown. Given his likely volume of work, Sproles can be started as a low-end RB3 in standard leagues and high-end one in PPR leagues."
32,Frank Gore,IND,CLE,18,43,31.5,5.0,"It's the rare scenario where the Colts should be in this game, despite not having Andrew Luck under center. Gore won't go for 100-plus yards on the ground or anything, but there were just four times last year where the Browns didn't allow a rushing touchdown. It's hard to bet on Gore as anything more than a low-end RB2, but this isn't a bad week to use him. "
33,Joe Mixon,CIN,GB,13,43,32.3,6.0
34,Duke Johnson,CLE,IND,9,51,32.4,6.0
35,Alvin Kamara,NO,CAR,25,55,34.9,4.4,"Kamara had a disappointing Week 2 against the Patriots from a usage standpoint, but his three receptions for 51 yards certainly provided fantasy owners with some value. Still, he played in just 26 percent of the Saints' offensive snaps and had just one carry. Kamara has a lot of talent, without question, but as of now, he's mired in a committee with Mark Ingram and Adrian Peterson. There is some speculation that Peterson may be cut soon and that possibility makes Kamara an option to target on the waiver wire immediately. Last year, Tim Hightower showed how productive the second running back behind Mark Ingram can be in New Orleans on a weekly basis, and Kamara is far more explosive than Hightower has ever been. Add him now, but plan for him to ride your bench until and unless Peterson gets cut or is injured."
36,Shane Vereen,NYG,PHI,24,46,35.1,4.3,"To the extent you're forced to rely on a Giants running back, Vereen is likely your best bet. Nobody from the backfield has much of a chance to have a significant fantasy impact in light of the offensive line, but Vereen's involvement in the passing game salvages at least a modicum of value. Vereen has just six carries this year but has 12 receptions for 78 yards. Considering the Giants' difficult in running the ball, and the coaching staff's dissatisfaction with Paul Perkins, expect Vereen's snap count and involvement to rise this week against Philadelphia. It's a tough matchup in a hostile environment, so even with the added touches, Vereen is nothing more than an RB4 in any format."
37,Jordan Howard,CHI,PIT,19,46,35.9,4.8,"Howard gave his fantasy owners one of the worst possible second weeks of the season. He contributed nothing in fantasy (seven yards on nine carries) and left the game with his arm in a sling without speaking to reporters. Howard was battling a shoulder injury heading into the game, so it seemed that perhaps he had aggravated the injury and would be forced to sit out in Week 3. But he's practiced on a limited basis so far, and insists he's good to go. But given the matchup against a tough Steelers defense, Howard's lingering shoulder injury, and Tarik Cohen's emergence, Howard is nothing more than a low-end RB2 this week, at best."
38,DeMarco Murray,TEN,SEA,18,61,36.7,6.7
39,Matt Forte,NYJ,MIA,26,53,39.4,3.7
40,Bilal Powell,NYJ,MIA,29,48,39.5,3.1
41,Samaje Perine,WAS,OAK,16,72,41.0,8.8,"After an awful preseason and an invisible Week 1, Perine was thrust into relevance in Week 2 against the Rams after Rob Kelley departed with a rib injury. Perine was hardly a world-beater, gaining only 67 yards on 21 carries (3.2 YPC), but he didn't turn the ball over or make any critical errors. The severity of Kelley's rib injury is unknown, but if he does miss time, Perine becomes an immediate starting option, as Chris Thompson, while incredibly effective, simply isn't big enough to be an every-down back.  Add Perine now, and if Kelley is out, start him against Oakland in Week 3 and going forward. "
42,Giovani Bernard,CIN,GB,26,49,41.5,3.7
43,Terrance West,BAL,JAC,32,63,43.3,5.6,"There's reports out there saying that West is dealing with a thigh injury that's caused him to miss practice this week. Even if he does play, he'll be at less than 100 percent against a Jaguars defense that is lights out. His teammate Javorious Allen is a better start, as he's the one to catch passes out of the backfield."
44,Chris Johnson,ARI,DAL,31,56,44.2,4.0,"Johnson was surprisingly the more effective running back for the Cardinals in Week 2 against the Colts, as he tallied 44 rushing yards on 11 carries versus Kerwynn Williams's 22 yards on nine carries. The Cardinals offense has been struggling mightily this season, and they need to establish a running game without David Johnson. Bruce Arians's track record suggests he'll go with whomever is most effective, and as of Sunday, that looked like Chris Johnson. Temper expectations, of course, as Johnson was obviously cut this offseason. But Johnson's potential to see a significant workload going forward makes him an intriguing add."
45,Tyler Ervin,HOU,NE,22,78,47.7,10.0
46,Paul Perkins,NYG,PHI,39,76,48.4,6.1,"There's simply no way to put Perkins in your lineups confidently right now, as he's struggled with the new look to the offense. There are rumblings that the Giants may give Orleans Darkwa the start against the Eagles. On top of the struggles, the Eagles front-seven will blow up any run plays the Giants try to attempt. He belongs on benches this week. "
47,Jamaal Charles,DEN,BUF,38,73,48.4,4.8
48,Jalen Richard,OAK,WAS,40,63,48.4,4.1
49,Charles Sims,TB,MIN,40,64,50.8,5.4
50,Robert Kelley,WAS,OAK,33,82,50.1,8.4,"It sounds like Kelley is going to play through his rib injury, which puts fantasy owners in a bit of a bind. Kelley had a dismal Week 1 before looking much better last week against the Rams before leaving with the injury. Week 3 does not present the greatest matchup for Kelley, as the Raiders struggle against pass-catching backs but have generally been solid against the run otherwise, not allowing a rusher to surpass 53 yards rushing this season. With the injury concerns, Kelley makes an RB3 here, at best."
51,Andre Ellington,ARI,DAL,30,67,51.4,6.2
52,D'Onta Foreman,HOU,NE,41,72,51.9,5.2,"Lamar Miller has been nothing more than a mediocre running back for years, and finally the Texans stopped feeding him the ball every down. Foreman was right up there in terms of touches, and looked like the superior running back in this backfield. Foreman isn't the starter yet, but at this point, it looks like only a matter of weeks before he takes over so add him now and play the waiting game."
