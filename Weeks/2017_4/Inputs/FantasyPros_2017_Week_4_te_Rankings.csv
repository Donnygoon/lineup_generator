1,Rob Gronkowski,NE,CAR,1,5,1.2,0.9
2,Zach Ertz,PHI,LAC,1,4,2.1,0.4,"Ertz has blossomed into a legitimate fantasy stud, playing more than 80 percent of the snaps, seeing between eight and 10 targets per week, and finally scoring a touchdown. The red zone targets - Ertz has seen three this season - is really what can bring him to the truly elite level. The Chargers aren't particularly tough against tight ends, as opposing quarterbacks have completed nine of 10 passes to the position this season against them. But even if they were, it's irrelevant right now for Ertz, who is one of the few true ""set it and forget it"" options at the position."
3,Travis Kelce,KC,WAS,1,5,2.8,0.6
4,Jimmy Graham,SEA,IND,3,18,5.5,3.0,"Graham surprisingly rebounded last week against the Titans despite playing through an ankle injury, as he caught seven of 11 targets for 72 yards. He was removed from the injury report this week, so he should be ready to go for Sunday night against the Colts. Indianapolis has barely been tested by tight ends this year, but they allowed the second-most yards per target last year to tight ends, and there's nothing to suggest that their defense has improved significantly against the position. Consider Graham a strong TE1 play."
5,Delanie Walker,TEN,HOU,3,12,5.8,1.7
6,Charles Clay,BUF,ATL,3,19,7.0,2.3,"Clay is averaging six targets per game this year, and has scored in two of three contests. With Tyrod Taylor preferring shorter passes, Clay and LeSean McCoy have been and should continue to be the primary beneficiaries. The Bills take on the Falcons this week, and they're likely to be playing from behind, meaning Clay should once again see plenty of targets. He's the top streaming tight end this week and makes a passable fantasy option on a weekly basis."
7,Kyle Rudolph,MIN,DET,3,19,8.4,3.3,"Rudolph has gone from the most targeted tight end in 2016 to one of the least targeted in 2017, as he ranks 20th in targets among the position with just 11. The Lions should present some opportunities for Rudolph, as they've allowed 11 touchdowns to the position since the start of 2016, including one to Rudolph last year. Despite his struggles, he's still firmly in the TE1 conversation in this matchup."
8,Jason Witten,DAL,LAR,4,24,8.6,3.2,"Witten came back down to earth in an extremely difficult matchup against the Cardinals last week, as he caught only one pass for three yards. Things get easier this week against the Rams, though not by all that much. The Rams have been tough against tight ends since the beginning of the 2016 season, and haven't allowed a big game to any opposing tight end yet this season. But with the difficulty in finding a reliable tight end in fantasy, Witten's consistent targets keep him as a TE1 here."
9,Jared Cook,OAK,DEN,2,23,10.7,3.8
10,Jordan Reed,WAS,KC,4,17,10.0,3.6,"Reed has been a limited participant in practice this week with his rib and shoulder injuries, and he'll likely be a game-time decision on Monday night against the Chiefs. The only way to possibly wait on Reed is if you also own Vernon Davis. But if you are in that position, it's not the worst matchup. Without Eric Berry, the Chiefs are very mediocre against opposing tight ends, and Reed's talent level would leave him as a borderline TE1. Unless it's clear by Sunday morning that he'll suit up or you own Davis, it would be wise to find another option."
11,Martellus Bennett,GB,CHI,4,29,12.0,4.1,"Bennett has been incredibly quiet this year despite seeing 21 targets on the season, third-most in the NFL among tight ends. With that level of volume, particularly from Aaron Rodgers, Bennett is eventually going to start producing. There's as good as ever that it will be in this game, as the Bears are down both Jerrell Freeman and Quintin Demps. Like most tight ends in this range, though, Bennett makes a low-end and risky TE1. "
12,Eric Ebron,DET,MIN,6,25,12.1,2.7,"Ebron has been disappointing this season, with just nine catches for 60 yards, but this week's game sets up well for him. The Vikings are very tough against the pass, but they're vulnerable against tight ends, having allowed 15 receptions for 131 yards and two touchdowns. With Xavier Rhodes likely to take out Marvin Jones, Matthew Stafford will need other options to go to, and Ebron is likely to be the beneficiary. He's a low-end TE1 in this one. "
13,Evan Engram,NYG,TB,4,26,12.5,3.5,"Engram is quietly breaking the curse of the rookie tight ends, as he has at least four receptions and 44 yards receiving in every game this season. The Bucs defense is incredibly banged up, which could lead to Engram getting run more pass routes, rather than being forced to stay in and block. The Bucs are generally tough on opposing tight ends, but Engram's consistency keeps him as a borderline TE1 on Sunday."
14,Coby Fleener,NO,MIA,6,23,14.6,3.6,"Through two games, the Dolphins look similar to how they did last year against tight ends. Get targeted and you'll produce. There was just one tight end who was targeted at least five times and failed to hit at least 9.5 PPR points (Lance Kendricks) against them last year. It's going to get tougher for Fleener to find production with Snead back, but when playing with Brees, anything is possible. Fleener remains on the fringe TE1 conversation.  "
15,Cameron Brate,TB,NYG,4,25,15.0,4.8
16,Jack Doyle,IND,SEA,7,24,15.6,3.2
17,Benjamin Watson,BAL,PIT,7,24,16.5,3.3,"Watson, like most Ravens offensive skill players, was quiet for most of Sunday against the Jaguars. But Watson saved his fantasy day by scoring a late and meaningless touchdown. It seemed pretty clear heading into Sunday that Watson would step right into the heavily-targeted Baltimore tight end role, which certainly has value in deep leagues. The Steelers, Watson's Week 4 opponent, have allowed at least four catches to tight ends in each of their first two games, and let Adam Shaheen score on Sunday. Watson's a reasonable streaming option next week and going forward."
18,Austin Seferian-Jenkins,NYJ,JAC,11,34,18.7,4.8,"Austin Seferian-Jenkins returned to game action after his two-game suspension to start the season and immediately saw more targets than any tight end with the Jets has since Week 6 of the 2014 season. Not that it was a massive amount (six targets), but it's a step in the right direction for a franchise that seems to be gunning for the No. 1 pick. The Jaguars have allowed 17 of the 22 intended targets to tight ends to be hauled in, including two touchdowns over the last two weeks to Jonnu Smith and Ben Watson. Seferian-Jenkins is most definitely on the TE2 streaming radar while Anderson and Kearse have tough matchups."
19,Zach Miller,CHI,GB,10,26,20.0,3.9,"Miller has been the most involved of the Chicago tight ends, but he's still splitting snaps with Adam Shaheen and Dion Sims. His lack of usage, and the Bears' general ineptitude in the passing game, keeps Miller from being a startable tight end in fantasy leagues. That's especially true against Green Bay, which has held opposing tight ends to just eight catches and 43 yards this season. "
20,Ryan Griffin,HOU,TEN,11,27,19.8,3.6,"Griffin was fantastic against the Patriots, pulling in five of six targets for 61 yards and a touchdown. With C.J. Fiedorowicz lost for the season, there's a huge void to fill in the Texans offense, and Griffin looks ready to fill it. With solid matchups in two of his next three games (Titans and the Browns), Griffin makes a fine add for the near- and long-term."
21,Hunter Henry,LAC,PHI,8,34,20.0,4.0
22,Vernon Davis,WAS,KC,7,39,21.5,5.9,"Davis had a huge night on Sunday against the Raiders filling in for Jordan Reed, catching all five of his targets for 58 yards and a touchdown. If Reed were to miss significant time, Davis would make a top priority add, and immediately slot in as a TE1. But it does not sound like Reed will be out that long, and even if Davis starts next week, he will draw the Chiefs, followed by a bye. With a tough matchup and little long-term value, Davis is more of a handcuff for Reed owners."
23,Julius Thomas,MIA,NO,12,31,22.1,3.5,"Julius Thomas is who we thought he was, as he's now gone 10 games straight failing to record more than 28 yards receiving. The Saints have allowed two tight end touchdowns this year, but they aren't the most tight-end-friendly defense. "
24,Jesse James,PIT,BAL,9,31,23.0,4.0
25,David Njoku,CLE,CIN,14,52,26.6,5.3
26,Jermaine Gresham,ARI,SF,13,38,27.2,4.8
27,Seth DeValve,CLE,CIN,15,41,29.8,4.9
28,Austin Hooper,ATL,BUF,14,38,25.2,3.8,"Hooper is still living off of his huge 88-yard touchdown in Week 1, but he's averaging just two targets per game on the season. He simply isn't featured in Steve Sarkisian's offense, and Matt Ryan has plenty of other tools at his disposal. The Bills are decent against opposing tight ends, and it's unlikely that Hooper gets back on track here. He's far from the TE1 discussion at the moment."
29,Antonio Gates,LAC,PHI,17,35,26.6,3.6
30,Tyler Kroft,CIN,CLE,18,34,28.0,3.8
31,Ed Dickson,CAR,NE,15,47,29.8,4.8
32,Jonnu Smith,TEN,HOU,18,46,35.4,5.7
33,C.J. Uzomah,CIN,CLE,19,65,43.5,11.3
34,Marcedes Lewis,JAC,NYJ,20,37,30.0,3.9,"Lewis had one of the most shocking fantasy performances in recent memory, with three touchdowns against the Ravens on Sunday. Considering that he had totaled three touchdowns in the last three seasons combined, fantasy owners shouldn't be expecting a repeat performance. He does have two decent matchups coming in with the Jets and the Steelers, but even then, he's only a streaming option in deep leagues."
