1,Tom Brady,NE,CAR,1,5,1.8,0.8,"Despite not throwing a touchdown in the opener, he's the No. 1 fantasy quarterback after three weeks. Just one week after Drew Brees toasted the Panthers for three touchdowns, they have to defend Brady in New England. Going back to Week 9 of last year, the Panthers haven't allowed a quarterback to post more than 20 fantasy points, but as we've seen with Brady, he defies what is considered logic. He's an elite QB1 every week, so it seems.  "
2,Aaron Rodgers,GB,CHI,1,8,1.8,1.1,"The last time Rodgers played the Bears while at home, he threw for 326 yards and three touchdowns. You don't need me to tell you to start him. "
3,Russell Wilson,SEA,IND,1,8,3.6,1.1,"Wilson finally produced for his fantasy owners last week, throwing for 373 yards and four touchdowns in a losing effort against the Titans. He'll now return home to face the Colts on Sunday night. It sounds like Vontae Davis will return, which helps the Colts defense, but it's no matter - Wilson should have no trouble exploiting the Colts' many holes. The one slight worry is the game script, in that the Seahawks are heavily favored and Wilson won't need to air it out. But Wilson has generally played just as well in blowout games as he does in close ones, so he should be a top-five quarterback play here."
4,Drew Brees,NO,MIA,1,14,3.7,1.8,"After watching Philip Rivers and Josh McCown combine for 9.4 yards per attempt against this Dolphins defense, Drew Brees has got to be licking his chops. Not just that, but they completed 79 percent of their passes in those first two games. The Dolphins lack a playmaking presence in their secondary and the closest thing they have to one is T.J. McDonald, who is suspended until mid-season. Seven of the last 12 quarterbacks to play against the Dolphins have totaled 20 or more DraftKings points. Brees is a lock-and-load QB1 in a plus-matchup.  "
5,Matt Ryan,ATL,BUF,1,26,4.9,2.5,"Ryan hasn't been great from a fantasy perspective, with only four touchdown passes through three games, but he's looked just fine overall.  His completion percentage and yards per attempt are way above his career-average, and the touchdowns will surely come. The Bills have allowed the fifth-fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks, but that number is a bit misleading, as they've played Josh McCown, Cam Newton, and Trevor Siemian. It's not the greatest matchup, but at home and with his weapons still healthy, Ryan is an easy top-five play this week."
6,Dak Prescott,DAL,LAR,4,24,7.2,3.1,"Dak Prescott has overcome a lot to start the season, stacking up 56 fantasy points in the first three weeks despite playing against the Giants, Broncos, and Cardinals. He's an elite QB1 this week against the Rams who have allowed 8.1 yards per attempt to the combination of Scott Tolzien, Kirk Cousins, and Brian Hoyer. This will be the first game where he can target Dez Bryant relentlessly without a top-10 cornerback draped to him in coverage."
7,Marcus Mariota,TEN,HOU,5,20,9.1,3.2,"Marcus Mariota has thrown just three touchdowns the first three weeks, but has somehow managed to still be a top-10 fantasy option. That's because they haven't dialed back his rushing attempts, despite his broken leg from a season ago. Mariota's 77 rushing yards are sixth at the position. He'll need to move a bit in this contest, as the Texans have a heck of a pass rush. The Texans have done a great job of limiting their opponents pass attempts over the last year and a half with just 33 attempts per game in 2016 and just 30.3 attempts this year. Given his rushing totals, Mariota can be safely played as a low-end QB1/high-end QB2 despite the tough matchup. "
8,Carson Palmer,ARI,SF,3,26,9.5,3.7,"Palmer had a big bounce-back game against Dallas on Monday night, throwing a whopping 48 passes for 325 yards and two touchdowns. He'll now take on a truly terrible 49ers pass defense that just allowed Jared Goff to throw three touchdown passes and which has registered just three sacks on the year. Palmer's offensive line is decimated, which puts a slight damper on an otherwise fantastic matchup. But with no running game to speak of and desperately needing a win, Palmer should have a big game here, and makes a fine QB1 this week."
9,Philip Rivers,LAC,PHI,5,25,9.6,3.3,"Philip Rivers gets a plus-matchup here against the Eagles who are coming off a game in which they allowed Eli Manning to throw for 366 yards and three touchdowns, almost all in the second half. They simply don't have the talent in their secondary to stop the Chargers passing attack, so it'd be shocking to see Rivers not finish as a top-10 quarterback this week. In his lone home game this year, he completed 31 of 39 pass attempts for 331 yards and a touchdown."
10,Kirk Cousins,WAS,KC,5,22,11.1,3.6,"Cousins looked fantastic against the Raiders on Sunday night, completing an awesome 83.3 percent of his passes and throwing for three touchdowns. But his life should get a lot tougher on Monday night against the Chiefs in Kansas City. Arrowhead Stadium is tough on opposing players on a good day, but in a nationally-televised game, it's likely to be incredibly imposing. The Chiefs are stingy against opposing quarterbacks, allowing just two passing touchdowns through three games.  Cousins is usually in the QB1 conversation, but this week, makes merely a mid-range QB2. "
11,Trevor Siemian,DEN,OAK,6,24,11.9,3.3
12,Matthew Stafford,DET,MIN,6,23,13.2,3.7,"Stafford hasn't been all that productive since his monstrous four-touchdown game against Arizona in Week 1, but he's been adequate overall, and was robbed of a bigger game with the ""Golden Tate touchdown that wasn't"" last week against the Falcons. But his task gets tougher in Week 4 with a matchup against the Vikings in Minnesota. The Vikings have limited Drew Brees, Ben Roethlisberger, and Jameis Winston in their three games this season, and Stafford averaged just 226 yards passing against them last season. With several good streaming options this week, Stafford is more of a high-end QB2."
13,Carson Wentz,PHI,LAC,7,23,13.9,3.5,"Wentz struggled a bit in Week 3 against the Giants, though his 18 fantasy points established a fairly high floor. He now gets to take on a Chargers defense that is down Logan Verrett for the season and has allowed the 13th-most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks. The Chargers are worse against the run than the pass, but it's unclear how effective the Eagles' run game will be without Darren Sproles. Wentz is a borderline QB1 this week, but is best considered a QB2 with upside."
14,Jay Cutler,MIA,NO,7,29,15.4,3.9,"After his 220-yard, one touchdown performance against the Jets, most won't ask ever want to start him again. With that being said, he's a very strong QB2 option against the Saints this week. They have allowed multiple touchdown passes in 13 of their last 17 games and have multiple defensive players ailing, including cornerbacks Delvin Breaux (who is out until further notice), Marshon Lattimore (missed last week), and Sterling Moore (missed last week)."
15,Andy Dalton,CIN,CLE,7,24,15.5,3.6,"All it took was a change in offensive coordinator (and a matchup against the Packers) to get Dalton to finally start putting up some numbers, as he completed nearly 78 percent of his passes and threw his first two touchdown passes of the season. This is much more of what was expected of the young quarterback heading into the season, where he was a popular sleeper. Now back on track, he gets a matchup with the Browns, who just allowed Jacoby Brissett to look like an elite quarterback. Dalton gets a fairly tough matchup at the Bills the following week, followed by a bye and a relatively tough schedule thereafter. In other words, he's mostly a streaming option next week, and then a likely bench/depth piece going forward."
16,Alex Smith,KC,WAS,4,25,15.7,4.5
17,Jameis Winston,TB,NYG,5,31,15.7,3.8,"Winston got going in garbage time against the Vikings last week, and finished with 328 yards passing and two touchdowns. But don't let yourself get fooled by those numbers, as Winston was not good for most of the game, throwing up three interceptions. His life won't get all that much easier this week against an extremely tough Giants pass defense that has held opposing quarterbacks to just 6.2 yards per attempt and four touchdowns through the first three games. Winston always has the possibility of a big game, but he falls outside the QB1 range this week."
18,Tyrod Taylor,BUF,ATL,7,27,16.6,4.0
19,Deshaun Watson,HOU,TEN,8,26,18.6,3.9,"Watson had his coming-out party against the Patriots in Week 2, completing 66 percent of his passes, throwing for two touchdowns, and rushing for 41 yards. Watson's rushing ability gives him a fairly high floor each and every week, and he seems to be getting more comfortable with the Houston offense each game. He'll take on the Titans and the Browns in two of the next three weeks, each of which was just lit up by the opposing quarterback (Russell Wilson and Jacoby Brissett, respectively). A matchup with the Chiefs in between those two could be daunting, but still, Watson's continued growth makes him a potential streaming option in the right matchup."
20,Ben Roethlisberger,PIT,BAL,8,28,19.3,4.0,"The Ravens held him to 264 yards and one touchdown in their 2016 Baltimore meeting, and just 220 yards with no touchdowns in the 2015 game. He's difficult to trust, though the Ravens traveling literally from a different country will have an effect on them. He's a high-risk/high-reward QB2 in Week 4."
21,Eli Manning,NYG,TB,7,28,20.1,3.8,"Manning got somewhat on track on Sunday against the Eagles, throwing three touchdown passes, though he was intercepted twice. He's far from being a reliable fantasy option at this point, but as Case Keenum showed last week, a decimated Bucs defense is easily exploitable. That looks like it will be the case this week, as the Bucs may be missing several key defenders, including Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David. Even so, Manning makes just a low-end QB2 until he can show some more consistency."
22,Cam Newton,CAR,NE,4,27,20.0,3.5,"Let's be clear about this, Cam Newton has never been an elite passer. Heck, I'd argue that's he's been below average in all but one of his NFL seasons (2015). To this point in the season, he's completed 51 of 83 passes (61.4 percent) for 566 yards (6.8 YPA) with two touchdowns. That would be his second-highest completion percentage in his seven-year career, while his yards per attempt is slightly below where it's been throughout a majority of his career (6.9-7.1 range). His shoulder may be causing him some discomfort, but this is who Newton has always been. The fact that he struggled against the Saints leaves you with zero confidence starting him in season-long leagues, but he makes for the perfect tournament play. Why? Because if Newton is struggling with his arm, there's only one solution - run. It also doesn't hurt that the Patriots have now allowed 20 or more fantasy points to each of the quarterbacks they've played this year. "
23,Jared Goff,LAR,DAL,9,29,22.6,3.8,"As everyone predicted in the preseason, the Rams have scored the most points in the NFL through Week 3. Although their defense has certainly played a large role, Goff's improved play under Sean McVay is a big part of the reason, as he has a 5:1 TD:INT ratio. The Cowboys and their revamped secondary have allowed six passing touchdowns over the last two games, and Goff should have the opportunity to make plays. But he's still far from a QB1 option at this point, and makes just a low-end QB2 choice, with plenty of other streamable options with better matchups. If he proves himself here, he'll need to be taken more seriously in fantasy circles."
24,Derek Carr,OAK,DEN,11,30,22.7,3.5
25,Blake Bortles,JAC,NYJ,14,30,24.3,2.8,"Just as everyone expected, Bortles torched the vaunted Ravens defense this weekend in London, throwing four touchdown passes and completing 64 percent of his throws. While just one game, the coaching staff allowed Bortles to throw more on rushing downs when the defense wasn't expecting it, which could lead to good things for Bortles in the future if the Jaguars stick to that script. He now gets to take on a Jets defense that, although it shut down Jay Cutler this weekend, is extremely beatable in the air. He's still Blake Bortles, and he follows up the Jets matchup with a game in Pittsburgh, so temper expectations. Still, with his potential, he's an add in most fantasy leagues, at least as a backup."
26,Case Keenum,MIN,DET,13,32,25.3,2.6,"After an awful 2017 debut against Pittsburgh in Week 2, Keenum excelled in Week 3 against the Bucs, completing 25 of 33 pass attempts for 369 yards and three touchdowns. But the Bucs were absolutely decimated on defense last week, so take Keenum's effort with a grain of salt. Although the Lions defense has produced several turnovers, they aren't an elite unit, though they've allowed fewer than 14 fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Don't get cute - Keenum is nothing more than a low-end QB2 in Week 4. "
27,DeShone Kizer,CLE,CIN,12,30,25.6,2.7,"The Bengals are not one to target, as they have held 14 of the last 19 quarterbacks they've played to either zero or one passing touchdown. Kizer is still on the QB2 radar due to his legs, but don't get excited about it. "
28,Mike Glennon,CHI,GB,20,33,29.3,2.4,"Oddly enough, the Packers have still yet to allow a quarterback to score more than 16 fantasy points and they've played Russell Wilson, Matt Ryan, and Andy Dalton. The reason is because those quarterbacks averaged just 27 pass attempts per game. Glennon will have more than that, but not enough for me to trust him as a streamer.  "
29,Brian Hoyer,SF,ARI,20,32,29.3,1.9,"Hoyer had a shockingly good performance against the Rams last Thursday, throwing for more than 300 yards and accounting for multiple touchdowns. While it was fun to watch, it's unlikely to continue on Sunday against the Cardinals. Carlos Hyde is banged up and will be a game-time decision, and Pierre Garcon will see a ton of Patrick Peterson. With his two top options limited, Hoyer is unlikely to find success otherwise, and makes one of the worst quarterback options of the week for fantasy."
30,Joe Flacco,BAL,PIT,23,32,28.9,1.4,"The Ravens offense has led the NFL in pass attempts over the last two years, but he's now thrown just 69 passes through three games. There were zero games in 2015 and 2016 where he threw the ball less than 30 times. The offensive philosophy has changed, but it hasn't produced results. The loss of Marshal Yanda proved to be large last week, as the run game struggled, as did Flacco, throwing for just 1.6 yards per attempt. The Steelers should get T.J. Watt back this week, as well as Stephon Tuitt, which will cause havoc for the Ravens and their injury-riddled offensive line. Flacco needs to be benched until we see that he can play without Yanda covering his behind.  "
