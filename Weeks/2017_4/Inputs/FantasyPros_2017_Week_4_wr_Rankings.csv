Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Antonio Brown,PIT,BAL,1,31,2.6,3.8,"You're starting Antonio Brown every week and Jimmy Smith doesn't change that. He burned the Ravens for 7/85/1 in their first meeting last year, and then 10/96/1 in the second meeting. He's a WR1 every week, regardless of the opponent.  "
2,Odell Beckham Jr.,NYG,TB,1,12,2.7,2.0,"Bizarre touchdown celebrations aside, Beckham was awesome on Sunday against the Eagles, catching nine of 13 targets for 79 yards and two touchdowns. He'll now go against a Bucs defense that would ordinarily be tough on opposing wideouts, but which has been decimated by injury. It sounds like Brent Grimes, though questionable, is likely to play through a shoulder injury, and that puts the slightest damper on Beckham's fantasy outlook. But it shouldn't matter all that much, as Beckham can succeed against anyone. He makes a rock solid WR1 regardless of Grimes' health."
3,A.J. Green,CIN,CLE,1,24,2.7,2.7,"It was very nice to see A.J. Green get the targets he deserves last week, turning in a performance of 10 catches for 111 yards and a touchdown. This week should promote a similar result, as the Browns are coming off a game in which they allowed T.Y. Hilton to go off for 153 yards and a touchdown. Don't forget that Antonio Brown totaled 182 yards against them in Week 1. If you want to take Green in DFS again, I urge you to do so, because it's hard to say that there's another receiver who I'd rather have at his price. "
4,Julio Jones,ATL,BUF,1,8,4.5,1.6,"Jones' season feels disappointing because he hasn't scored a touchdown and he ranks 11th in targets, but he's still fourth in the NFL in receiving yards with 265. The Bills have allowed the eighth-fewest fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, but they haven't yet faced anyone on Jones' level. Whether it's E.J. Gaines or Tre'Davious White who gains the unenviable task of dealing with Jones, expect the big receiver to have an excellent day here and look to get into the end zone for the first time."
5,Michael Thomas,NO,MIA,1,15,5.3,2.0,"Michael Thomas gets his first matchup of the year where he won't be trailed by one of the top cornerbacks in the game. He has been able to post rock-solid numbers while doing so, including seven catches for 87 yards and a touchdown against up-and-coming star James Bradberry last week. You should get dividends on your 2nd round pick this week against the Dolphins group of cornerbacks. They have no answer for him - he's an elite WR1 play. "
6,Jordy Nelson,GB,CHI,1,20,6.8,2.9,"Nelson has scored three touchdowns in just two games (he started in Week 2 against the Falcons but left early with a quad injury), and he's clearly the best red zone threat on the Packers. He'll now take on a Bears defense that has struggled against opposing No. 1 wide receivers this year, allowing an average of seven catches and 90 yards, with two total touchdowns to each one through the first three games. Nelson is a WR1 regardless of matchup, and this week is no different. "
7,Keenan Allen,LAC,PHI,3,22,7.8,2.9
8,Mike Evans,TB,NYG,2,33,9.0,4.4,"It's another tough matchup just one week after seeing Xavier Rhodes in coverage. Winston has shown the willingness to target Evans no matter who is covering him, so he's still starting on fantasy teams as a WR2, at worst, even though Janoris Jenkins is a legit shutdown cornerback. "
9,DeAndre Hopkins,HOU,TEN,4,31,10.7,4.7,"This is a week where you should pound DeAndre Hopkins into lineups. He should return to his heavily-targeted role after the Patriots rolled coverage his way in Week 3, limiting his opportunities. The Titans have some real issues in their secondary and have already allowed a combined six touchdowns to wide receivers and tight ends. With Watson looking better in Week 3, it gives Hopkins owners hope that he can get back to WR1 status, though I see him as more of a WR2 a majority of the time. This week, expect him to be more of a WR1 against the combination of Adoree Jackson and LeShaun Sims. "
10,Larry Fitzgerald,ARI,SF,1,29,12.1,4.5,"Fitzgerald went crazy on Monday night against Dallas, catching 13 of 15 targets for 149 yards and a touchdown. While it's unlikely that he'll see quite that level of involvement again this year, he'll have a chance at another huge game against the 49ers on Sunday. The San Francisco defense is awful against the pass, and Fitzgerald can run rings around slot cornerback K'Waun Williams.  Game script is a worry here, as it's unlikely that the Cardinals will need to continue to air it out like they did against Dallas on Monday. But with another great matchup, Fitzgerald makes a strong WR2 play."
11,Dez Bryant,DAL,LAR,2,27,12.6,4.6,"Bryant is now averaging 9.0 targets per game, the second-highest mark of his career. Rams cornerback Trumaine Johnson is a solid defender, he's not on the level of Patrick Peterson or Janoris Jenkins, who were both able to shut Bryant down. While Johnson hasn't allowed a touchdown in coverage yet this year, he is allowing over 10 yards per target and has been susceptible to the big play. "
12,Brandin Cooks,NE,CAR,5,28,12.7,3.8,"The Panthers almost always keep James Bradberry at LCB, so Cooks should see plenty of Daryl Worley, who wasn't asked to cover Brandin Cooks when they played the Saints last year. He is a slower cornerback and one that would get burned by Cooks, should they leave him one-on-one. Cooks is a borderline WR1 play with Brady slinging it the way he is. "
13,Tyreek Hill,KC,WAS,2,51,14.8,6.7,"Tyreek Hill bombed in a great matchup against the Eagles two weeks ago, but got back on track against the Chargers last week with 90 total yards and a touchdown. The Redskins haven't used Josh Norman in shadow coverage, so there's no reason to shy away from Hill as a WR2 in this matchup. Even if Norman did cover him, Hill's world class speed is unmatched in man coverage.  "
14,Stefon Diggs,MIN,DET,4,26,14.9,4.1,"Diggs was a monster against the Bucs, with eight catches for 173 yards and two touchdowns, showing that he can absolutely succeed with Case Keenum under center. But expectations need to be kept in check, as the Bucs were absolutely decimated by injuries to their defense. Diggs will draw a much tougher matchup here against the Lions and likely Darius Slay, one of the better cornerbacks in the league. Slay isn't a true shutdown corner like Diggs' teammate, Xavier Rhodes, but he certainly presents a challenge. The matchup is enough to keep Diggs out of the WR1 conversation, but he's established himself firmly as a WR2 in any matchup right now. "
15,Jarvis Landry,MIA,NO,5,25,15.2,3.0,"Jarvis Landry has seen 26 targets through two games, but that's netted them just 126 yards, which is not what you'd call efficient. Expect Landry to have a bigger game when Parker is dealing with a legit shutdown cornerback. He isn't this week, so Landry falls into the WR3 conversation.  "
16,Demaryius Thomas,DEN,OAK,6,25,15.3,3.4,"Did you know that Thomas has just one red zone target this year, while Emmanuel Sanders and Bennie Fowler have combined for eight of them? He's simply not offering you the WR1 potential that he did in years past. "
17,Devante Parker,MIA,NO,7,48,15.9,5.4,"It's very clear that DeVante Parker is Cutler's go-to-guy in this offense, as he's now been targeted 19 times, despite having the toughest matchup on the field. I referenced this stat before the season, but here are Parker's averages in games where he sees five or more targets: 4.4 receptions for 71.1 yards and 0.4 touchdowns, which would amount to 13.7 PPR points per game. If Lattimore is out, this could be a monster week for Parker. I'd feel confident playing him as a WR3 with WR1 upside.  "
18,Golden Tate,DET,MIN,2,24,17.2,3.0,"Golden Tate is a fine play as a WR2 who'll match-up with 39-year-old Terence Newman in the slot. Newman has been solid over the last couple years, but he's showing signs of fatigue, already allowing two touchdowns in his coverage this year on just 16 targets. "
19,Doug Baldwin,SEA,IND,4,41,19.2,7.9,"Baldwin is officially a game-time decision, but all signs point to him suiting up on Sunday night against the Colts. It's a good matchup, of course, but there are a few warning signs. Vontae Davis should return for this game, and he will likely shadow Baldwin. In addition, the Seahawks are likely to win handily, and there should not be a reason to air out the football or put Baldwin at risk. Still, Baldwin's elite skills and talent keep him as a high-end WR2 play here, at worst."
20,Emmanuel Sanders,DEN,OAK,9,54,19.3,5.2
21,Alshon Jeffery,PHI,LAC,10,28,19.7,3.3,"Most will see that Jason Verrett is out for the year and think that Jeffery is in the clear, but they also have Casey Hayward, who was asked to shadow wide receivers last year and wound up making the Pro Bowl. He's a rock-solid cornerback, so it'd be wise for Carson Wentz to look at different avenues. "
22,Sammy Watkins,LAR,DAL,8,45,23.1,5.7,"It was good to see Sammy Watkins get onto the stat sheet last week with 106 yards and two touchdowns, and owners should be pleased that this matchup calls for another big game. The Cowboys don't have that alpha at cornerback, so they'll try to defend him by committee, which should end well for Watkins owners. With their injuries piling up, they've allowed the combination of Emmanuel Sanders and Larry Fitzgerald to post 19/211/3 against them. Slot Watkins in your lineup as a WR2 before his schedule gets extremely difficult. "
23,Adam Thielen,MIN,DET,16,45,24.2,4.5,"Thielen has yet to find the end zone in 2017, but his fantasy owners can't be complaining, as he's totaled 19 receptions and is second in the NFL in receiving yards behind only Antonio Brown. The Lions present a tough matchup for the Vikings receivers, but much more so for Stefon Diggs than Thielen, as the former will have to deal with Darius Slay. The Lions are much weaker against slot receivers, so Thielen should once again provide plenty of receptions and great yardage totals on Sunday."
24,Davante Adams,GB,CHI,13,40,24.8,4.7,"Adams has had an up-and-down year so far, being held to three catches in two of the Packers' three games, but totaling eight catches in Week 2 against Atlanta. Jordy Nelson barely played in the latter game, and with Nelson fully healthy, Adams is a bit risky here. Still, the Packers should have a big game at home on Thursday night against a Bears defense missing safety Quintin Demps, and each of the Packers receivers is in play. Adams makes a fine WR2 in this one. albeit with a modicum of risk. "
25,Amari Cooper,OAK,DEN,14,40,25.2,5.2,"It's officially the time for Amari Cooper supporters to crawl in the fetal position and cry. He's been bad this year, but not in the way that Terrelle Pryor is bad. Cooper is so frustrating because he's getting open seemingly at will, but he's now dropped a league-leading six passes. He's just 23 years old, so don't give up on him or anything, but it's been frustrating for sure. The Broncos are a tough matchup, but not one that you should run from. Cooper is one of the six wide receivers who was able to score against the Broncos last year and he actually lines up on Bradley Roby's side more than he does on Aqib Talib's side."
26,T.Y. Hilton,IND,SEA,14,41,27.4,4.8,"Hilton is nothing more than a WR4 against a Seahawks secondary that has yet to allow a wide receiver more than 87 yards this year. We all know that Hilton isn't the scoring type, so he needs to continually beat the defensive back in coverage, something that's unlikely to happen with Earl Thomas watching over things over the top.  "
27,Chris Hogan,NE,CAR,18,46,28.3,4.7,"Chris Hogan came through for a second straight week, despite being labeled as questionable with a knee injury coming in. The Texans simply forgot to cover him on both of his touchdowns last week. A full-time player who is seemingly healthy in the Patriots offense? He's now seen six targets in back-to-back games. Sign me up as having him in lineups as a WR3 almost every week."
28,Rishard Matthews,TEN,HOU,13,49,29.0,6.0
29,Pierre Garcon,SF,ARI,11,51,29.5,6.7,"Pierre Garcon is going to be shadowed by Patrick Peterson, who has held Dez Bryant to 2/12/1, T.Y. Hilton to 4/49/0, and Marvin Jones to 2/37/1 through three games. We know that Garcon isn't the scoring type, so it's fair to call him a risky WR3 this week. I'd prefer to play an upside WR4 over him this week.  "
30,Jamison Crowder,WAS,KC,23,53,31.9,4.4,"Crowder caught all six of his targets against Oakland last week, but for just 52 yards. Though he appears to have fully recovered from his hip injury, he was a late addition to the injury report on Friday with a hamstring injury. It sounds as now as though Crowder will play Monday night against the Chiefs and it's not a terrible matchup, as the Chiefs' slot cornerbacks are not particularly strong. But given Crowder's lack of performance so far this season, he makes a WR4 in standard leagues."
31,DeSean Jackson,TB,NYG,24,55,32.5,5.3,"DeSean Jackson will see Eli Apple for a majority of his snaps, which is the most exploitable matchup in that Giants secondary. Though he played with a different quarterback, Jackson totaled 5/96/1 in the first game and then just 2/34/0 in the second game. Bottom line, Jackson can win this matchup and is a WR3 once again this week. "
32,Terrelle Pryor,WAS,KC,9,65,33.5,6.8,"It's been an extremely disappointing season for Pryor thus far, as he's caught just 10 passes and only four in his last two games. Between drops and poor route-running, Pryor just has not gained Kirk Cousins' trust enough to become an integral part of the offense. Marcus Peters will likely be on Pryor for the majority of Monday night's game against the Chiefs, which would be just another detriment to his potential fantasy value. But either way, he's a borderline Flex option here, and is likely better left on fantasy benches."
33,Martavis Bryant,PIT,BAL,25,70,34.2,6.9,"Martavis Bryant technically has the better matchup of the Steelers wide receivers with Brandon Carr, who doesn't have the wheels to hang with Bryant (not that anyone does). He's done a fine job in coverage, but is also a 31-year-old whose best years are likely behind him. The touchdown that speedster Allen Hurns scored last week was in his coverage. Start Bryant as an ultra-high upside WR3."
34,Randall Cobb,GB,CHI,22,60,34.3,7.6,"Cobb has been removed from the injury report and will play on Thursday night, but he's also got the toughest matchup on the field with Bryce Callahan. This may be a week to play another option if you have one. Cobb offers risk of re-aggravation in a matchup they really don't need him to win. "
35,Marqise Lee,JAC,NYJ,25,48,34.7,4.3,"Lee has 19 targets since Allen Robinson went down with a torn ACL, and looks to be Blake Bortles' favorite target, despite Allen Hurns finding the end zone more often. The Jaguars next take on a Jets defense that allowed five touchdown passes in the first two weeks of the season, and Lee should see plenty of work. Although it's a prime matchup, Lee should retain value throughout the season, and makes an excellent bench option at worst, and a viable WR3 at best."
36,Kelvin Benjamin,CAR,NE,13,102,34.9,10.5,"If you've been around the notes section before, you know that you don't want to be a No. 1 option facing the Patriots. They'll bracket them all game, not allowing that one specific player beat them. Benjamin is also gimpy after having his knee rolled up on last week. "
37,Sterling Shepard,NYG,TB,24,66,38.4,6.0,"The Giants offense woke up on Sunday, and all of their receivers benefited. Shepard saw 10 targets and hauled in seven of them, en route to 133 yards receiving and a touchdown. Brandon Marshall similarly came back to relevance on Sunday, and had more targets and catches than Shepard. But the young receiver now has 22 targets through three games, and should continue to be a big part of the offense. He'll take on a decimated Bucs defense in Week 4 before going against the Chargers and Broncos. While the schedule isn't fantastic, Shepard is still worth an add, and should be at least a bench option and a bye-week filler."
38,Tyrell Williams,LAC,PHI,21,66,37.5,6.2
39,Jeremy Maclin,BAL,PIT,21,72,38.3,6.6,"It wouldn't shock me if Flacco drops back to pass 40-plus times this week. Because of that, Maclin should be played as a WR3 in season-long leagues and is the only wide receiver you can semi-trust on this offense."
40,Allen Hurns,JAC,NYJ,29,63,40.4,5.9,"Hurns isn't seeing quite the targets that Marqise Lee is since Allen Robinson tore his ACL, but he's finding the end zone, scoring touchdowns in each of his last two games. Blake Bortles showed on Sunday that the Jaguars passing attack has some punch to it. making both Lee and Hurns viable options. The Jaguars take on the Jets next week, and New York has allowed six passing touchdowns through three games. Hurns is a fine add for a bench piece and can easily be started in any given week."
41,Mohamed Sanu,ATL,BUF,15,71,44.2,8.1,"Sanu has burned his fantasy owners before, but its hard not to like what he's been doing lately. He has 21 targets through three games and scored his first touchdown on Sunday. As the WR2 in an excellent offense, Sanu should offer a decent floor, while also having the potential for a few big games sprinkled in. His immediate schedule isn't that enticing, as the Falcons take on the Bills in Week 4 before their bye week. But they'll get the Dolphins coming out of the break, and you can bet that Sanu will be a viable starting option in Week 6."
42,Eric Decker,TEN,HOU,26,61,43.3,5.4,"It's been a rough start to the season for Eric Decker who has seen 18 targets, but has turned them into just 10 catches for 91 yards. You want to bet on him to bounce back, as he is someone who scored in 12 of 16 games the last time he played a full season, so maybe it's just a chemistry thing with Mariota. He'll match-up with Kareem Jackson, who is a veteran, but one who lacks height (5-10) to defend someone like Decker if he were to box-out in the end zone.  "
43,Brandon Marshall,NYG,TB,20,69,44.9,7.4,"Marshall looks like the wide receiver we saw last year, as he's caught just 50 percent of his targets, while all of the other wide receivers have hauled in 73 percent of their targets. He's just a name right now who may score a touchdown from time-to-time, but he's given us nothing to believe he'll produce anything more than WR4/5 numbers.  "
44,Devin Funchess,CAR,NE,19,56,45.8,6.3,"Kelvin Benjamin apparently does not have any structural damage in his knee, but it's unclear how much time he'll miss. With Greg Olsen also being lost for a significant period of time, Funchess is pretty much the last man standing. He caught just four passes for 58 yards against the Saints, but should see a huge increase in targets going forward. Although his long-term value probably isn't that high, he gets a fantastic matchup with a Patriots defense that has given up eight passing touchdowns through three games. For those in need of a WR3, he makes a decent plug-and-play option."
45,Jordan Matthews,BUF,ATL,29,77,46.9,7.8
46,J.J. Nelson,ARI,SF,23,78,47.3,8.5
47,Kenny Stills,MIA,NO,27,75,48.7,6.5,"Kenny Stills is always the odd man out when analysts discuss the Dolphins receivers, but he makes for an interesting play in tournaments. Before playing the struggling Cam Newton, the Saints had allowed 14 passing touchdowns in their last five games. Consider him a touchdown dependent WR4/5 in season-long leagues.  "
48,Paul Richardson,SEA,IND,34,69,48.8,6.4,"Richardson has just eight catches on the season, and has just 49 yards receiving over the last two games. With Tyler Lockett getting healthy, Richardson's role is clearly decreasing. But Doug Baldwin is dealing with a groin injury, and the Seahawks take on the Colts this weekend. He's far from safe, but especially if you need a one-week filler, Richardson isn't the worst option to bet on."
49,Cooper Kupp,LAR,DAL,33,67,49.1,7.5
50,Ted Ginn,NO,MIA,31,75,50.0,7.9,"Ginn did not make the most of Willie Snead's absence, as he saw just 14 targets and had nine receptions for 121 yards in three games, though he did score a touchdown last week against the Panthers. Ginn defines ""boom-or-bust,"" but he's got a good chance to boom this week against a porous Dolphins secondary. Snead's return muddies the water a bit, but could actually help Ginn, as he'll receive somewhat less attention from opposing defenses. None of the Miami cornerbacks can match Ginn's speed, so he'll have a chance to go big here."
51,Danny Amendola,NE,CAR,30,70,51.8,7.7
52,Jermaine Kearse,NYJ,JAC,35,81,52.4,8.0
53,Tyler Lockett,SEA,IND,31,69,52.0,7.3
54,Kenny Britt,CLE,CIN,22,69,54.3,6.9,"After looking like he could be a cut candidate with questions about his effort, Britt came back into relevance on Sunday against the Colts, catching three passes for 54 yards and a touchdown. Two things bode well for Britt going forward: His high target volume in the game (10) and the lack of any viable alternative at receiver for Cleveland. The Browns aren't good, but should be playing from behind most weeks, meaning Britt should be heavily involved."
55,Marvin Jones,DET,MIN,32,72,55.6,6.6,"If you were to peek at the NFL's NextGenStats through three weeks, you'd see Marvin Jones as the wide receiver with the least amount of separation when targeted, meaning he's getting 50/50's or jump balls essentially all the time. It's the reason his only production has come from touchdowns. That'll be tough to do in Week 4 against the Vikings, who field some of the better cornerbacks in the league, and Jones will see a lot of Xavier Rhodes, who has shut down Antonio Brown and Mike Evans the last two weeks. Don't play Jones this week if you can help it.  "
56,Robert Woods,LAR,DAL,39,75,57.2,8.9
57,Kendall Wright,CHI,GB,17,73,58.2,8.9,"Just when Wright was looking like he'd be getting double-digit targets weekly, he was targeted zero times in last week's win over the Steelers. That was likely an outlier, as Mike Glennon targeted his wide receivers only four times all game. They'll need to throw in this game to keep up with a strong Packers offense, and the Green Bay secondary is far from elite. Wright isn't a play in any fantasy league right now, but he should at least get back on track from a target standpoint. "
58,Travis Benjamin,LAC,PHI,37,83,59.6,8.4,"Travis Benjamin was the forgotten Chargers wide receiver this offseason, but he's just a couple fantasy points off Allen's production. He's kind of the Torrey Smith of this offense with a better deep-ball quarterback, so he's going to be big-play-or-bust a majority of the time. This matchup is solid, so consider him a contrarian play to my Tyrell Williams take, because it shouldn't shock anyone if he gets behind the Eagles secondary.  "
59,Taylor Gabriel,ATL,BUF,44,78,60.4,7.2,"After two ""busts,"" Gabriel had his ""boom"" on Sunday against Detroit, hauling in five of six targets for 79 yards and a score. The first three games indicate exactly what you'll get with Gabriel - several weeks where is unplayable and then a handful where he explodes. He's third in the pecking order behind Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu, and without consistent targets, he's simply a bye week fill-in."
60,John Brown,ARI,SF,40,112,66.9,15.0
61,Jaron Brown,ARI,SF,38,82,61.5,8.9
62,Rashard Higgins,CLE,CIN,42,79,61.0,6.7,"Just one week after seeing 11 targets, Rashard Higgins went back to being the guy who was on a practice squad two weeks ago, hauling in just two passes for 11 yards against the Colts. Don't give up on him just yet, though, as he'll have the best matchup on the field in Week 3 against the Bengals Darqueze Dennard, who was bench material in 2016. Higgins doesn't come without risk, but he's looking like a WR4 in this matchup. "
63,Seth Roberts,OAK,DEN,41,104,72.3,16.5
64,Kenny Golladay,DET,MIN,45,110,66.3,14.5
65,Robby Anderson,NYJ,JAC,45,77,64.0,7.1,"Anderson is a big-play threat, as shown by his 69-yard touchdown catch on Sunday against the Dolphins. He was also targeted six times, tied for the team lead. Anderson is still behind Jermaine Kearse as the Jets receiver to own, and his tough matchup in Week 4 (Jacksonville) and inconsistent play make him less of an exciting add, and more someone to stash to play in the right matchup."
66,Brandon Coleman,NO,MIA,40,96,72.0,12.4
67,Marquise Goodwin,SF,ARI,36,87,67.6,9.3,"Marquise Goodwin as someone who could surprise in his matchup with Justin Bethel, who has been abused in coverage so far this year. Goodwin has seen 17 targets, so it's not like he hasn't been targeted, either. We saw him connect with Hoyer last week on a 50-yard pass play, so maybe the chemistry has started to develop.  "

74,Josh Doctson,WAS,KC,48,119,77.5,12.0,"Doctson has seen his snap percentage increase each week, and he finally hit a home run on Sunday night, catching a 52-yard touchdown pass for his only reception of the night (and the year). Doctson's talent is immense, but he simply isn't being used enough to warrant fantasy consideration. He should only be added in leagues with deep benches, and where you don't intend to start him for at least several weeks."
75,Terrance Williams,DAL,LAR,47,93,71.5,9.0
76,Will Fuller,HOU,TEN,44,125,75.8,11.5
77,Geronimo Allison,GB,CHI,47,104,76.8,12.5,"Allison's value depends entirely on the health of Randall Cobb, as Allison caught six of eight targets for 122 yards on Sunday against the Bengals with Cobb out of the lineup. The severity of Cobb's injury is unknown, but with a short week, it's a fair bet that he'll miss another game. Against a relatively weak Bears secondary and with Aaron Rodgers throwing him the ball, he's a fine add for a one-week play, and could have the potential for more value if Cobb misses additional time."

83,Bruce Ellington,HOU,TEN,56,117,83.6,11.9,"Ellington caught four passes for 59 yards and a touchdown against the Patriots on Sunday, which marked his first scored in 28 career games. Ellington isn't a priority target for Deshaun Watson in the passing game, and the road to him being a valuable fantasy asset is extremely long and windy. He's not a target in anything but the deepest of leagues."
