Rank,Player Name,Team,Matchup,Best Rank,Worst Rank,Avg Rank,Std Dev,Status
1,Kareem Hunt,KC,WAS,1,5,1.8,1.2,"He's taken the league by storm, and has 15.7 more points than the next closest running back in standard leagues and he's only getting more work, according to Andy Reid. Before shutting down the Raiders run game, who totaled a miniscule nine carries, the Redskins allowed the Eagles and Rams backfields to combine for 41.3 standard points and 52.3 PPR points. To this point, Hunt has accounted for 89 percent of the fantasy production for Chiefs running backs. He's an elite RB1 and my No. 3 running back for the rest of the season.  "
2,Le'Veon Bell,PIT,BAL,1,11,2.9,1.9
3,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,LAR,1,8,3.3,1.7,"Ezekiel Elliott overcame an extremely difficult matchup against the Cardinals last week to post a rock-solid 18.4 PPR points. It was good to see after the debacle against the Broncos. This figures to be a massive game for him, as the three teams who have played the Rams have averaged 30 carries per game and have scored five rushing touchdowns, the most in the NFL. Aaron Donald has now been back for two games, and they allowed four touchdowns in those games, so it's not that. Marlon Mack was the RB17, Chris Thompson was the RB5, and Carlos Hyde was the RB6 against them. Start Zeke as you normally would and target him in DFS.  "
4,Todd Gurley,LAR,DAL,1,10,4.7,1.8,"The Dallas secondary is gross, but their run defense isn't that bad. You shouldn't get used to Todd Gurley winning you fantasy weeks, after all, as he has just one 100-yard game in his last 21 games. He's still in the RB1 conversation, but not alongside of names like Hunt and McCoy this week. "
5,LeSean McCoy,BUF,ATL,1,13,5.4,2.5,"After two bad outings, LeSean McCoy is going to be under-owned in DFS this week, something that you should take advantage of. The Falcons have seen the fewest rushing attempts in the NFL through three games, so it's difficult to say that they turned around what was one of the weaker run defenses in the league last year. McCoy is involved regardless of game-script, and this one plays into his pass catching abilities, as running backs have already accumulated 25 receptions for over 200 yards and two touchdowns against them. McCoy is a high-end RB1, especially in PPR formats. "
6,Devonta Freeman,ATL,BUF,1,34,6.9,4.4,"Devonta Freeman is on a touchdown-scoring frenzy, as he now has four rushing scores through three games. He's also been much better at home or inside domes over his career, so there's no reason to avoid him in this contest, even though the Bills run defense has looked extremely solid under Sean McDermott. They've allowed just one touchdown through three games, but they haven't been what we would call high-powered offenses. Freeman has taken command of the timeshare into what we thought it would be when the season started and has now out-snapped Tevin Coleman 116 to 74. Freeman is a low-end RB1 for this contest due to it being at home.  "
7,Leonard Fournette,JAC,NYJ,1,15,8.3,3.2,"There are just two running backs in the league with more carries than Leonard Fournette right now and just four of them with more touchdowns. Keep in mind that Fournette has been the No. 5 fantasy running back while playing against the Texans, Titans, and Ravens over the first three weeks of the season, who allowed the 3rd, 7th, and 9th fewest rushing yards to opponents last year. The Jets are the first plus-matchup he's had. "
8,Dalvin Cook,MIN,DET,2,14,8.4,2.7,"Dalvin Cook has been the workhorse of this offense to this point, racking up 71 of the 96 touches for Vikings running backs. He also got a goal-line carry last week and scored his first touchdown. There are concerns about his potential with Keenum under center, but you're going to play a running back who is at home with a strong defense behind him. The Lions aren't the best matchup for running backs, however, as they've only allowed one running back to top 86 yards rushing against them in their last 15 games and that was Devonta Freeman with Davis out last week.  "
9,Ty Montgomery,GB,CHI,2,17,10.0,2.9,"Montgomery is a locked in RB1 against a Bears defense who has allowed a rushing touchdown in each of their last six games, including multiple rushing touchdowns in two of them. It's also worth noting that Montgomery's best games last year came against the Bears. "
10,Melvin Gordon,LAC,PHI,4,17,10.4,1.9,"Melvin Gordon is reportedly dealing with a bone bruise on his knee, which is what led to Branden Oliver playing more snaps in Week 3. The Chargers are saying that it's not a big deal, but it's also enough for me to downgrade him to an RB2 against an Eagles defense that has allowed just 111 yards on 42 carries (2.64 YPC) outside of one 53-yard Kareem Hunt touchdown run. It's not to say that Gordon isn't startable, as he's now scored in 10 of his last 15 full games. "
11,Christian McCaffrey,CAR,NE,2,34,10.6,4.2,"After Greg Olsen went down, McCaffrey immediately saw 11 targets in the first game. Cam Newton is struggling to throw the ball beyond 10 yards, so it makes sense for him to target McCaffrey a ton. The Patriots have somehow already allowed running backs to accumulate 17/253/2 through the air, so keep McCaffrey in lineups as an RB2 this week with plenty of upside. "
12,Jay Ajayi,MIA,NO,2,23,10.7,4.6,"After totaling just 16 yards on 11 carries against a weak Jets run defense, you have to wonder if Jay Ajayi's knee is bothering him more than they're letting on. He did miss a lot of practice time last week and beat reporters were saying he had a hitch in his step when he returned to practice. If he misses more practice this week, he's an easy fade in DFS cash games, even if it is the Saints. Keep in mind that despite their reputation, there have been just two running backs who've been able to run for more than 85 yards against the Saints in their last 19 games. They have allowed 25 touchdowns to running backs in those games, however, and we know Ajayi gets all the goal-line work. "
13,Tarik Cohen,CHI,GB,7,39,14.8,4.4,"Earlier this week, I said that Cohen should be compared to Christian McCaffrey when projecting them every week. They both see tons of targets, will receive a handful of carries, and play on teams who may find themselves in a hole from time to time. That's the case this week as the Bears head to Green Bay to play a Packers team that will hop out into an early lead, and the Bears will be forced to throw more than they're used to, which is great for Cohen. "
14,C.J. Anderson,DEN,OAK,2,21,15.2,2.6,"For whatever reason, the Broncos decided to cool down the red-hot C.J. Anderson last week and give him just eight carries after he totaled 45 of them in the first two games. While yes, Jamaal Charles looked solid, why take away Anderson's momentum? He played his usual amount of snaps, so don't assume that this is going to be a thing to worry about going forward, especially considering they lost that game. Anderson doesn't have the greatest matchup this week, as the Raiders have now held opposing running backs to just 3.86 yards per carry through three weeks without a single rushing touchdown. That's a big difference from last year when they allowed 13 rushing scores, so it could be the small sample size, as there weren't any drastic changes to this linebacking corps, though rookie defensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes has been a cog in the middle of the field. Anderson should be played as an RB2."
15,Carlos Hyde,SF,ARI,8,29,15.3,4.0,"Hyde is going to be a game-time decision with his hip injury, but even if he plays, it's hard to think that he'll provide much fantasy value on Sunday. The Cardinals have allowed just 2.76 yards per carry this season, which includes last week's game against Ezekiel Elliott. Given Hyde's very questionable status and a tough Arizona defense, he'll be nothing more than a mid-range RB2 even if he plays."
16,Jordan Howard,CHI,GB,5,27,15.7,3.8,"Howard showed how dangerous it is to sit him in any given week, as he rushed for 140 yards and two touchdowns against the Steelers despite being highly questionable with a sprained AC joint in his shoulder. Howard is off the injury report this week, which seems strange, as he had to leave last week's game several times to have his shoulder worked on. But, given his performance, it's hard to worry too much about the injury. Tarik Cohen's presence and effectiveness takes some of Howard's appeal away, particularly when the Bears will likely need to throw often, but his high ceiling in any given week keeps him as a solid RB2 here. "
17,Joe Mixon,CIN,CLE,9,38,16.7,4.5,"Just one week after the Bengals fired their offensive coordinator Ken Zampese, Mixon gets a season-high in snaps, touches, and yards. Coincidence? No. Mixon is going to be ""the guy"" in this backfield going forward and what better way to get his confidence up than playing him a ton against the Browns in Week 4, a team that's allowed three touchdowns to running backs over the last two weeks. "
18,Chris Carson,SEA,IND,8,34,16.9,3.8,"Don't let last week get you down, because Carson had a brutal matchup. In this game, however, Carson is a must-play in a game where the Seahawks are at home, almost two point favorites, and may be without their top wide receiver. "
19,DeMarco Murray,TEN,HOU,7,32,19.4,4.1,"I'm not going to automatically assume that Murray is back to normal just because of a long run against the Seahawks. Derrick Henry is going to continue to push him for snaps regardless, limiting Murray's upside. In a matchup where they'll head to Houston, Murray is still in the RB2 conversation, but they could go with the hot-hand at any time. "
20,Chris Thompson,WAS,KC,9,44,20.0,4.9,"Thompson has lit the world on fire so far this season, scoring four touchdowns and busting out multiple 50-yard-plus plays. But it's simply incredibly difficult to be consistently productive at an elite level when you're seeing just nine touches per game, as Thompson has. The Chiefs have allowed just 13 receptions for 89 yards to opposing running backs, so the matchup doesn't set up perfectly for Thompson. But given how productive he has been, and the fact that the game script likely favors him, he still makes a borderline RB2 here."
21,Mark Ingram,NO,MIA,12,46,20.9,4.6,"Ingram owners are frustrated at the continued presence of both Adrian Peterson and Alvin Kamara, but really, Ingram is in the same position he was in last year when he was a reliable RB2. He's seeing roughly 50 percent of the snaps, nearly identical to his load last year. He's got a great shot at a big game on Sunday in London against the Dolphins, who have allowed a rushing touchdown in both games this season. The Saints are banged up on the offensive line, which could potentially limit Ingram's production, but his involvement in the offense and the passing game in particular gives him a high floor on Sunday. "
22,Javorius Allen,BAL,PIT,14,39,24.7,4.8,"Javorius Allen is someone to consider now that Terrence West is in the doghouse, as he played a position-high 34 snaps, though the results weren't ideal in a tough matchup against the Jaguars. Jordan Howard, Tarik Cohen, and Benny Cunningham combined to catch 12 passes last week for 73 yards against the Steelers, which bodes well for Allen who has seen 13 of the backfield's 17 targets since Danny Woodhead went down. Consider Allen a solid RB3 in PPR formats, but a tad riskier in standard leagues.  "
23,Lamar Miller,HOU,TEN,13,40,25.1,4.0,"Not only does Miller now have to worry about D'Onta Foreman competing for snaps, but Alfred Blue is due back this week. Combine that with the tough matchup against the Titans who have allowed just six rushing touchdowns in each of the last two seasons. Miller is headed towards a timeshare. "
24,Bilal Powell,NYJ,JAC,15,41,26.2,6.7,"The Jaguars defense has been legit, but if there's one area they have been lacking, it's against the run where they have allowed 261 yards and two touchdowns over the last two weeks to the Titans and Ravens run games. Matt Forte is going to miss this game and rookie Elijah McGuire fumbled last week, so Powell should be locked into a feature role. "
25,Duke Johnson,CLE,CIN,10,49,26.4,6.3
26,Mike Gillislee,NE,CAR,11,48,26.8,5.2,"There were just three games that LeGarrette Blount didn't score a touchdown last year and that you should expect something similar out of Mike Gillislee. Be happy that he got one of those games out of the way in Week 3. The Panthers aren't a much better opportunity for him, though, as they've allowed just six rushing touchdowns in their last 18 games. But it's also important to keep in mind that with the way Brady is throwing the ball, it's difficult to remain in a base defense and load the box with eight or more defenders. "
27,Theo Riddick,DET,MIN,20,38,27.1,3.1,"While in a full-time role last year, Theo Riddick was only able to post 134 total yards on 29 touches against the Vikings in two games combined. He's just a desperation play in PPR leagues and belongs on benches in standard leagues.  "
28,James White,NE,CAR,18,40,27.8,4.0,"White is playing a ton of snaps in a Patriots offense that continues to put up points. White needs to remain in fantasy lineups, especially with Rex Burkhead sidelined. "
29,Tevin Coleman,ATL,BUF,19,42,29.3,4.4,"Coleman has averaged 9.7 touches per game to this point, which means that he'll be big play or bust the majority of the time. It's difficult to say that'll come this week, as we've already talked about - the Bills haven't allowed much scoring. Coleman is just a desperation option at flex, who shouldn't be relied on without Freeman missing time.  "
30,Isaiah Crowell,CLE,CIN,15,43,30.0,4.9,"It's been a brutal start to the season for Crowell, who may start losing carries to his teammate Duke Johnson, who is just more of a playmaker, whereas Crowell basically gets what is blocked the majority of time. Not only does this game have negative game-script written all over it, but the Bengals already tough run defense now gets back their best linebacker Vontaze Burfict. "
31,Marshawn Lynch,OAK,DEN,20,45,30.1,4.3,"Despite playing against Melvin Gordon, LeSean McCoy, and Ezekiel Elliott, the Broncos defense has allowed just 142 rushing yards through three games and not one rushing touchdown. Lynch and the Raiders offense aren't quite in-sync yet and playing on the road against the Broncos won't fix that. "
32,Ameer Abdullah,DET,MIN,22,39,30.4,3.9,"Abdullah has gotten plenty of work this season, with at least 17 touches per game, but it hasn't led to a ton of production, particularly lately. It's doubtful that he can reverse that trend in Week 4, as the Vikings have yet to allow a touchdown to a running back, and have allowed just 171 rushing yards on 56 carries this season. Abdullah's history is right in line with those numbers, as he's gained just 3.7 yards per carry in his two meetings with Minnesota. The volume keeps him relevant, but Abdullah is a Flex play at best this week."
33,Alvin Kamara,NO,MIA,20,52,32.5,4.5,"Kamara found the end zone on Sunday against the Panthers, but it wasn't a positive day for his fantasy value overall. He received only five touches, and once again saw Adrian Peterson remain relevant and take a large share of the running back workload (11 touches). Kamara has loads of talent, but just doesn't receive enough work to be a fantasy contributor right now. His talent makes him a stash, but he's much more of a bench piece for now until Peterson gets cut and/or Mark Ingram gets injured."
34,Jacquizz Rodgers,TB,NYG,18,49,33.8,5.6,"After scoring a touchdown in Week 2 against the Bears, Rodgers disappeared in Week 3 against the Vikings, totaling just five carries for 15 yards. He essentially split snaps with Charles Sims, as the Bucs fell way behind and needed to pass frequently, particularly in the second half. That's unlikely to be the case this week, as the Bucs should continue to try to attack the Giants on the ground all game in light of New York's outstanding pass defense. The Giants are vulnerable to the rushing game, as they've allowed at least 105 rushing yards in every game this season. Still, with last week fresh in fantasy owners' minds, Rodgers makes a borderline RB2 here, at absolute most."
35,Jonathan Stewart,CAR,NE,22,49,34.4,4.4,"Stewart has continued to see a steady workload this season, recording at least 13 touches in each game. But Week 4 presents its challenges, as the Patriots, for all their defensive deficiencies against the pass, are much more solid against the run. Although New England is certainly susceptible to allowing production to pass-catching backs, that fact obviously favors Christian McCaffrey over Stewart, as does a likely negative game script. He could always score at the goal-line, but he's not in the RB2 discussion this week."
36,Wendell Smallwood,PHI,LAC,24,47,35.9,4.2,"LeGarrette Blount was the Eagles back to own on Sunday against the Giants, but Wendell Smallwood is the primary beneficiary of the Darren Sproles injury. Smallwood not only saw the most touches among the Eagles running backs on Sunday (13), but also saw far more snaps than Blount (43 to 22). Doug Pederson loves to rotate his running backs, and Corey Clement will play a role. But Smallwood has a major opportunity to grab the Philadelphia backfield, and makes the top waiver-wire add."
37,Frank Gore,IND,SEA,24,46,36.8,4.2,"It was the best possible scenario for Frank Gore against the Browns last week - he was at home, the Colts were winning throughout the entire game, it was the Browns, and he got 25 carries. He ended the game with 57 yards and a touchdown. The dream is over, guys."
38,Andre Ellington,ARI,SF,20,60,38.2,6.2
39,Shane Vereen,NYG,TB,32,56,39.0,4.3
40,LeGarrette Blount,PHI,LAC,25,53,40.4,5.3,"Blount found the end zone and received 12 carries last week against the Giants, but it's unclear how much his role will change with Darren Sproles' injury, if at all. Blount was significantly out-snapped by Wendell Smallwood last week, and played only 29 percent of the snaps after Sproles left the game with his injury. The Chargers struggle against the run, allowing the most rushing yards in the league to running backs, but they've allowed only one touchdown to the position. The end zone is where Blount finds his fantasy value, and, given his low snap count, it seems unlikely that he'll have any sort of significant fantasy impact on Sunday."
41,Derrick Henry,TEN,HOU,30,57,41.0,4.0
42,Giovani Bernard,CIN,CLE,21,58,41.0,4.9
43,Jamaal Charles,DEN,OAK,24,57,43.2,4.4,"Charles turned back the clock a bit on Sunday against the Bills, averaging 6.2 yards per carry and scoring a touchdown. He also looked far more effective than C.J. Anderson in the game. Charles has now received 10, nine, and nine carries in the first three games, and it's clear he's going to be getting at least that amount of work each week. He has shown he has the ability to provide fantasy value with that number of carries, and he's splitting time with a notoriously injury-prone player in Anderson. Charles' production plus potential make him a strong target in fantasy leagues."
44,Chris Johnson,ARI,SF,19,49,43.2,5.0,"Johnson has looked nothing like a savior for the Arizona backfield, but he continues to get carries on first and second down. Although Andre Ellington has looked far more effective, he does his best work in the receiving game. With Bruce Arians already stating that he wants to protect Ellington, and with a positive game-script likely in the works against the 49ers, chances are that Johnson will see the most work. The 49ers have the 23rd-ranked rush defense and allow more than 100 yards rushing per game. That makes Johnson, even with his total ineffectiveness this year, a desperation Flex play."
45,Terrance West,BAL,PIT,23,60,44.8,6.0
46,Robert Kelley,WAS,KC,23,58,44.8,6.0,"It appears that Kelley is going to suit up for Monday night's game against the Chiefs, and Jay Gruden made it clear that Kelley will return to his starting role. The Chiefs have been decent, though unspectacular, against opposing running backs in terms of rushing yards allowed, but they're also seeing opposing rushers average about 23 carries per game. If Kelley gets that workload, he'll likely be a borderline RB2 by pure necessity. But with him still nursing the rib injury and Chris Thompson's emergence, it's unlikely that he'll approach that number. Consider him a borderline Flex play, at best. "
47,D'Onta Foreman,HOU,TEN,33,56,47.6,3.9,"Lamar Miller is still the lead dog in the Houston backfield, but Foreman has shown how explosive he can be. Although he has averaged just 3.3 yards per carry so far, he caught his first two passes this week, turning them into gains of 34 and 31 yards. Foreman should continue to see at least 10 touches per week, and would be an instant RB1 should Miller go down."
48,Paul Perkins,NYG,TB,37,62,48.9,4.2
49,Samaje Perine,WAS,KC,44,84,52.6,8.6
50,Matt Breida,SF,ARI,35,70,54.6,8.5

54,Tyler Ervin,HOU,TEN,40,97,54.8,9.1
55,Orleans Darkwa,NYG,TB,43,74,56.2,6.9,"Darkwa has looked much better than Paul Perkins the entire season, and although he hasn't quite overtaken Perkins just yet, he got his most action of the season on Sunday, with seven carries and one reception. The Giants' offensive line isn't going to make anyone particularly fantasy relevant, but any running back potentially getting 10 touches or more per week is worth a look. He did leave this past game with a back injury, but it does not yet sound serious. He's worth an add as a bench piece, but there are other better options."
56,Charles Sims,TB,NYG,37,70,57.2,6.1
57,Branden Oliver,LAC,PHI,38,79,57.8,7.6,"Oliver is the clear backup to Melvin Gordon, as had 12 touches on Sunday against the Chiefs while Gordon missed about half the game with a knee injury. It's been deemed a ""minor"" bone bruise for Gordon, and he should play next week, but the fact that he couldn't make it through Sunday's game in full is worrisome. Oliver isn't special, but he's an obvious handcuff to a running back fighting an injury. That's worth an add in most fantasy leagues."
58,Elijah McGuire,NYJ,JAC,37,80,56.9,7.5,"The Jets have a crowded backfield, with McGuire splitting time with both Bilal Powell and Matt Forte. McGuire is clearly on the losing end of the split, as both Powell (30) and Forte (22) saw more snaps than him (12). But Forte is dealing with a toe injury, and isn't the healthiest player to begin with. If he misses time, then McGuire could see more than 10 touches per game. Still, there are plenty of backs to own ahead of him."
59,Adrian Peterson,NO,MIA,39,71,59.0,5.8
60,Alex Collins,BAL,PIT,46,92,57.8,8.4,"Collins was surprisingly involved in Sunday's game against the Jaguars, gaining 82 yards on nine carries. Although he got some of that in garbage time, he was involved in the game early on, seeing time in the backfield before Javorius Allen. The Ravens already split carries between Allen and Terrance West, and Collins' involvement just muddied the water further. He's a bench add for now, but nothing more."

68,Corey Clement,PHI,LAC,47,77,61.6,6.4,"Clement carried the ball six times for 22 yards and scored a touchdown on Sunday against the Giants, as he finally saw some action after Darren Sproles' injury. Clement should see the field a lot more going forward, and Doug Pederson isn't shy about using three backs. It's likely that Wendell Smallwood will get the first opportunity to run with the job, but rest assured, Clement will get a handful of touches. Still, at this point, he's more of a handcuf, who can be used as a desperation bye-week play."
