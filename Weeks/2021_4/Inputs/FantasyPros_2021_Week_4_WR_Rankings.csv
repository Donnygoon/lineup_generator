This past week against Jacksonville, Moore only saw three targets and he hauled in two of them for one net receiving yard. We shouldn't be completely off of Moore after this performance, but it does serve a purpose to remind us about his potential inconsistencies in this offense until he's seeing the majority of the snaps.
