It's worth remembering that Peyton Manning completed 56.7% of his passes as a rookie in 1998, threw more interceptions (28) than TD passes (26), and averaged 6.5 yards per pass attempt. Some people think Lawrence is the best QB prospect to enter the league since Andrew Luck, whose rookie season was no picnic either. Luck completed 54.1% of his passes as a rookie in 2012, threw 23 TD passes and 18 interceptions, and averaged 7.0 yards per attempt. Through three games, Lawrence is completing 54.1% of his passes, has a TD-INT ratio of 5-7, and is averaging 5.7 yards per attempt. Lawrence's arm talent is evident, but he's probably made more bad decisions in his first three games with the Jaguars than he made in three seasons at Clemson. His first good game probably isn't far off. I don't know if we'll see in Week 4, with a short workweek at a date with a Bengals defense that unexpectedly ranks fourth in Football Outsiders' DVOA metric. Cincinnati has recorded 10 sacks and is allowing only 6.0 yards per pass attempt.

The most glaring of those shortcomings is a paucity of talent at wide receiver, so Lynn is running the offense through his two primary RBs and his stud TE. Goff has directed 54.2% of his throws at his RBs and TEs. His average of 3.3 air yards on completions is second-lowest in the league behind only Matt Ryan, according to Next Gen Stats. Bottom line: Goff is getting the ball out quickly and getting it to his best pass catchers. That formula isn't going to lead to a lot of big games unless Goff gets the sort of weird game script he got in Week 1 when he attempted 57 passes, but it's keeping the Lions' offense afloat, and Goff is the QB14 in fantasy right now.
