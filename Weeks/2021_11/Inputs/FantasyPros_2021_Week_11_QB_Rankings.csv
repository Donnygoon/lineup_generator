Detroit's injury-plagued defense has been leaky against the pass, yielding a league-worst 8.5 yards per pass attempt. But Detroit also has a run-funnel defense, largely because the Lions constantly find themselves in negative game scripts. Opponents are running against the Lions on 50% of their offensive snaps, the second-highest rate in the league. With Mayfield not 100% healthy and Nick Chubb expected back after landing on the COVID-19 list for Week 10, there's a good chance the Browns will be extremely run-heavy this week. Mayfield lands at QB25 in this week's rankings despite the Lions' defensive issues.",,,QB22,D,15.5,0.22989999999999997

Ryan completed 9 of 21 passes against Dallas for 117 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. The veteran quarterback has been trying to make do with a bare-bones WR corps. Atlanta traded Julio Jones to Tennessee in June, and Calvin Ridley played five games before taking a mental-health sabbatical. In the first six games of the season, Ryan averaged 40.7 pass attempts and 278.0 passing yards per game, throwing 12 TD passes and four interceptions. In the three games since Ridley stepped away, Ryan has averaged 26.0 pass attempts and 202.0 yards per game, throwing three TD passes and four interceptions. Ryan now gets a tough Thursday-night draw against a Patriots defense that has more interceptions (14) than TD passes allowed (13) and is giving up 14.6 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks, the third-lowest total in the league. He's merely a back-end QB1 this week.",,,QB23,D-,15.3,0.11684736842105263
