That's been a bigger obstacle to Gibson's fantasy success in 2021 than the shin injury - the vagaries of game script. Too often this season, a negative game script has limited Gibson's snaps while working in favor of McKissic, the passing-down back. McKissic played 28 snaps against the Buccaneers and had 2-4-0 rushing and 4-35-0 receiving. Gibson is a midrange RB2 this week against a middle-of-the-road Carolina run defense.

He's missed the last three games with an ankle injury. Howard and Scott have been splitting work fairly evenly in Sanders' absence, with rookie Kenneth Gainwell playing a peripheral role. Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said on Wednesday that Sanders would start upon his return, but it seems unlikely that Howard and Scott would disappear from the offense after sparking the Philadelphia offense in recent weeks. Howard has 41-211-3 rushing over his last three games, making him the RB14 in half-point PPR fantasy scoring over that span even though he hasn't had a single catch. Scott has had 33-181-2 rushing and 2-24-0 receiving in the last three weeks, making him the RB22 over that stretch. For now, Sanders remains unranked. Howard and Scott are both upper-end RB3s in a tough matchup against the Saints' league-best run defense. If Sanders returns, none of the Philly backs will be trustworthy for fantasy purposes in Week 11.",,,RB46,D,6.2,2.425503125
